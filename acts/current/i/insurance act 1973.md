##### 2A  Main object of this Act

    * (1) The main object of this Act is to protect the interests of policyholders and prospective policyholders under insurance policies (issued by general insurers and Lloyd's underwriters) in ways that are consistent with the continued development of a viable, competitive and innovative insurance industry.

    * (2) This Act, and the prudential standards determined by APRA under this Act, achieve this mainly by:

     * (a) restricting who can carry on insurance business in Australia by requiring general insurers, and the directors and senior management of general insurers, to meet certain suitability requirements; and

     * (b) imposing primary responsibility for protecting the interests of policyholders on the directors and senior management of general insurers; and

     * (c) imposing on general insurers requirements to promote prudent management of their insurance business (including requirements concerning capital adequacy, the valuation of liabilities, reinsurance arrangements and the effectiveness of risk management strategies and techniques); and

     * (d) providing for the prudential supervision of general insurers by APRA; and

     * (e) providing for judicial management of general insurers whose continuance may be threatened by unsatisfactory management or an unsatisfactory financial position, so as to protect the interests of policyholders and financial system stability in Australia; and

     * (f) providing for policyholders, who have valid claims connected with certain policies issued by certain general insurers that are under judicial management and that APRA believes are insolvent, to be paid by APRA the amounts to which the policyholders are entitled before they would receive payment in winding up of the general insurers.

    * (3) Generally, the provisions of this Act apply to general insurers. However, there are a number of special provisions that apply only to Lloyd's underwriters.

     * (a) give written notice to the insurer; and

##### 16A  Continuation of effect of general insurer's authorisation

    * If APRA gives a notice of revocation of a general insurer's authorisation under subsection 15(5) or 16(2), the notice may state that the authorisation continues in effect in relation to a specified matter or specified period, as though the revocation had not happened, for the purposes of:

     * (a) a specified provision of this Act or the regulations; or

     * (b) a specified provision of another law of the Commonwealth that is administered by APRA; or

     * (c) a specified provision of the prudential standards;

    * (5) If APRA approves an assignment, the general insurer must:

     * (a) comply with the conditions on the approval; and

     * (b) give reasonable notice (in writing) of the assignment to the insurer's policyholders; and

    * he or she is punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding 60 penalty units.

    * (9) An offence against this section is an offence of strict liability.

        * Note 1: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (4) An affected policyholder is entitled, on the person's request, to be provided by the company with one copy of the scheme free of charge.

    * (5) The Federal Court may dispense with the need for compliance with paragraph (2)(c) in relation to a particular scheme if it is satisfied that, because of the nature of the scheme or the circumstances attending its preparation, it is not necessary that the paragraph be complied with.

##### 17D  Actuarial report on scheme

    * (1) When a copy of a scheme has been given to APRA for the purpose of paragraph 17C(2)(a), APRA may arrange for an independent actuary to make a written report on the scheme.

        * Note: Before doing such an act, the judicial manager will usually need to get and consider a report on the fair value of each share or right concerned (see section 62ZA), and will need to report to the Federal Court and obtain the court's order for the act (see sections 62ZI and 62ZJ).

    * Giving company members notice of exercise of powers

    * (2) As soon as practicable after doing an act described in paragraph (1)(a), (b), (c) or (e) or subsection (3), the judicial manager must give written notice to the persons who were members (under section 231 of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of the company just before the act, identifying the act and explaining its effect on their interests as members.

     * (b) then allocate that value among the classes of shares in the company that either have been issued or that the judicial manager proposes to issue (taking into account the relative financial risk, and voting and distribution rights, of the classes); and

     * (c) then allocate the value of each class pro rata among the shares in that class that either have been issued or that the judicial manager proposes to issue (without allowing a premium or applying a discount for particular shares in that class).

    * (9) APRA must:

     * (a) publish a copy of a determination under subsection (8) in the _Gazette_; and

    * The main purpose of this Part is to provide for a scheme that: 

     * (a) allows the Minister to make a declaration about a general insurer:

      * (i) that is under judicial management and APRA believes is insolvent; or

      * (ii) for which an external administrator has been appointed under Chapter 5 of the _Corporations Act 2001_ and APRA believes is insolvent; and

     * (b) entitles certain persons, who have valid claims connected with certain protected policies issued by a declared general insurer, to be paid certain amounts before they would receive payment in a winding up of the general insurer; and

     * (c) substitutes APRA for those persons as a creditor of the declared general insurer to the extent of the entitlements.

    * The Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine that persons in a specified class do not have entitlements under this Part.

##### 62ZZA  Allowing extra time for claims

    * (2) An instrument made under subsection (1) that specifies a day in relation to a single claim identified in the instrument is not a legislative instrument.

    * (3) Otherwise, an instrument made under subsection (1) is a legislative instrument.

    * (4) As soon as practicable after making an instrument described in subsection (2), APRA must take the steps it considers reasonable to inform a person whom it believes could make the claim concerned of the day specified in the instrument.

#### Division 2--Declaration of general insurer

##### 62ZZC  Declaration that Division 3 applies in relation to general insurer

    * (1) The Minister may declare that Division 3 applies in relation to a specified general insurer if:

        * Note 1: Section 116A deals with assets and liabilities in Australia.

        * Note 2: The declaration does not end the judicial management of the general insurer.

    * Declaration to specify amount for meeting entitlements

    * (2) The declaration must also specify the amount (if any) that is to be credited to the Financial Claims Scheme Special Account in connection with the application of Division 3 in relation to the declared general insurer. The amount must not be more than $20,000,000,000.

    * (5) The Minister cannot revoke a declaration made under subsection (1).

    * Declaration or amendment not disallowable or subject to expiry

    * (6) A declaration made under subsection (1), or an amendment of the declaration, is a legislative instrument, but neither section 42 (disallowance) nor Part 6 (sunsetting) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ applies to the declaration or amendment.

    * Effect of declaration or amendment

    * (7) The declaration or amendment:

     * (a) takes effect from the time it is made, despite subsections 12(1) and (2) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_; and

     * (b) has effect according to its terms.

    * Declaration not to specify general insurer by reference to class

    * (8) Subsection 13(3) of the _Legislative Instruments Act 2003_ does not apply to a declaration under subsection (1) specifying a general insurer.

        * Note: This ensures that a declaration must specify a general insurer individually, and cannot specify it by reference to a class of general insurers.

##### 62ZZD  Advice and information for decision on making declaration

    * (1) The Minister may give APRA, ASIC or the Reserve Bank of Australia a written request for advice or information about a matter relevant to making a decision about making a declaration under section 62ZZC (including a matter relating to the affairs of a general insurer).

    * (2) The person is entitled to be paid by APRA an amount equal to the insurer's liability to the person in respect of the claim if APRA determines that the amount of the liability is less than $5,000.

        * Note: Section 62ZZI requires APRA to determine not only whether the insurer has a liability in respect of the claim but also the amount of the liability.

    * Claims worth $5,000 or more

    * (3) The person is entitled to be paid by APRA an amount equal to the insurer's liability to the person in respect of the claim if APRA determines that:

     * (a) the amount of the liability is $5,000 or more; and

     * (b) the person meets the conditions prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note 1: Section 62ZZI requires APRA to determine not only whether the insurer has a liability in respect of the claim but also the amount of the liability.

        * Note 2: Section 62ZZJ requires APRA to determine whether the person meets the prescribed conditions, if the person applies for the determination.

    * Different claim periods for different claims

    * (4) To avoid doubt, regulations for the purposes of subparagraph (1)(b)(i) or (ii) may prescribe different days for the purposes of that subparagraph applying in relation to different claims or claims under different cover.

##### 62ZZG  Entitlement to payment of third party

    * Who this section covers

    * (1) This section applies to a person if:

     * (a) the person may recover an amount (the **_recoverable amount_**) in accordance with a determination made by APRA under subsection 62ZZJ(4); and

     * (aa) the person makes a claim in relation to the recoverable amount, in the approved form (if any), within the period:

      * (i) starting on the day prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subparagraph; and

      * (ii) ending on a day prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subparagraph or, if APRA specifies a later day, that later day; and

     * (b) the person is not covered by a determination under section 62ZZ.

    * Recoverable amounts less than $5,000

    * (2) The person is entitled to be paid by APRA an amount equal to the recoverable amount if APRA determines that the recoverable amount is less than $5,000.

        * Note: Section 62ZZJ requires APRA to determine not only whether it is satisfied the person could recover under section 51 of the _Insurance Contracts Act 1984_ but also the amount the person could recover.

    * Recoverable amounts of $5,000 or more

    * (3) The person is entitled to be paid by APRA an amount equal to the recoverable amount if APRA determines that:

     * (a) the recoverable amount is $5,000 or more; and

     * (b) the person meets the conditions prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph.

        * Note 1: Section 62ZZJ requires APRA to determine not only whether it is satisfied the person could recover under section 51 of the _Insurance Contracts Act 1984_ but also the amount the person could recover.

        * Note 2: Section 62ZZJ also requires APRA to determine whether the person meets the prescribed conditions, if the person applies for the determination.

##### 62ZZH  Entitlement on basis of notionally extended cover

    * (1) If the period of insurance cover provided under a protected policy issued by a general insurer, or in respect of which liability has been accepted by a general insurer, includes the time when the insurer becomes a declared general insurer, sections 62ZZF, 62ZZG, 62ZZI and 62ZZJ apply as if the period of the cover extended for 28 days after that time, even if:

     * (a) the policy is cancelled within those 28 days; or

     * (b) the period of the cover would otherwise have ended before the end of those 28 days.

        * Note: The effects of applying sections 62ZZF and 62ZZG as if the period of cover were extended include those sections applying as if:

         * (a) the entitlement to claim under that cover were correspondingly extended; and

         * (b) the liability of the insurer were also extended in respect of such claims.

    * (2) However, if the policyholder cancelled the policy within those 28 days, those sections apply as if the period of the cover extended only until the cancellation of the policy.

##### 62ZZI  APRA must determine insurer's liability in respect of claim

    * (1) If APRA becomes aware that a person has, in the period described in paragraph 62ZZF(1)(b), made a claim under insurance cover provided under a protected policy of a kind referred to in paragraph 62ZZF(1)(a), APRA must determine in accordance with the policy:

     * (a) whether the insurer is liable to the person in respect of the claim; and

     * (b) the amount of that liability (if any).

    * (1A) Without limiting subsection (1), the amount of the liability (if any) determined under subsection (1) may be an amount agreed to by APRA and the person.

    * (2) The determination must be made in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after APRA becomes aware that the claim has been made.

##### 62ZZJ  Determinations APRA must make on application

    * Determination that person meets conditions prescribed

    * (1) Subsection (2) has effect if a person applies to APRA, in the approved form (if any), for a determination that the person meets the conditions prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of paragraph 62ZZF(3)(b) or 62ZZG(3)(b).

    * (2) APRA must determine in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the application is made, whether the person meets the conditions.

    * Determination that person may recover amount from insurer

    * (3) Subsection (4) has effect if a person applies to APRA, in the approved form (if any), for a determination that APRA is satisfied that section 51 of the _Insurance Contracts Act 1984_, or section 601AG of the _Corporations Act 2001_, permits the person to recover an amount from a general insurer because of insurance cover the insurer provided under a protected policy:

     * (a) that the insurer issued before becoming a declared general insurer; or

     * (b) in respect of which liability was accepted by the insurer before becoming a declared general insurer.

    * (4) APRA must determine in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable after the application is made:

     * (a) whether APRA is satisfied that section 51 of the _Insurance Contracts Act 1984_, or section 601AG of the _Corporations Act 2001_, permits the person to recover an amount from the general insurer because of the insurance cover; and

     * (b) what that amount (if any) is.

    * (4A) Without limiting subsection (4), the amount (if any) determined under subsection (4) may be an amount agreed to by APRA and the person.

    * Giving applicant notice of determination

    * (5) As soon as reasonably practicable after making a determination under subsection (2) or (4), APRA must give the applicant a copy of the determination.

##### 62ZZK  Payment

    * (1) A person's entitlement under this Division to be paid an amount may be met:

     * (a) by paying the amount to the person as a single amount or in instalments determined by APRA; or

     * (b) by applying the amount, as a single amount or in instalments determined by APRA, for the person's benefit; or

     * (c) by paying part of the amount to the person and applying the rest of the amount for the person's benefit.

    * (2) The regulations may make provision for or in relation to the ways in which persons' entitlements under this Division to be paid amounts may be met.

##### 62ZZKA  Giving information about payments in a financial year

    * (1) This section applies if one or more amounts are paid to, or applied for the benefit of, one or more persons (the **_recipients_**) in a financial year to meet (wholly or partly) the recipients' entitlements under this Division.

    * Giving each recipient an annual statement

    * (2) Within 14 days after the end of the financial year, APRA must give each of the recipients a statement about the amounts paid to, or applied for the benefit of, the recipient in the financial year. The statement must:

     * (a) be in the approved form; and

     * (b) name the recipient; and

     * (c) state the recipient's tax file number, if APRA knows it; and

     * (d) state the total of the amounts and the total of the amounts (if any) withheld from them under the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_; and

     * (e) specify the financial year to which the statement relates.

    * Giving the Commissioner of Taxation an annual report

    * (3) Within 4 months after the end of the financial year, APRA must give the Commissioner a report in the approved form about all the amounts described in subsection (1).

    * Provisions about statements and reports in approved forms

    * (4) Division 388 in Schedule 1 to the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ applies as if this section were a taxation law for the purposes of that Act.

        * Note: That Division sets out rules about approved forms and when they can be given.

    * This section does not limit the Taxation Administration Act 1953

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not limit the operation of the _Taxation Administration Act 1953_ in relation to APRA.

##### 62ZZL  Substitution of APRA as insurer's creditor

    * (1) When a person's entitlement arises under this Division, the rights the person had against the general insurer in relation to the protected policy cease to be rights of the person and become rights of APRA, by force of this subsection.

        * Note 1: A person's entitlement arises under this Division when all of the relevant conditions in section 62ZZF or 62ZZG are met. This will generally happen at the last time APRA makes a relevant determination under section 62ZZI or 62ZZJ.

        * Note 2: APRA's right against the general insurer has the same priority in the winding up of the general insurer as it would have had if it had continued to be a right of the person.

    * (2) APRA may exercise or assign a right it has under subsection (1).

        * Note: Under section 11 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_, APRA's property is generally held on behalf of the Commonwealth.

##### 62ZZM  Meeting of entitlement taken to be payment by insurer

    * (1) When an amount of a person's entitlement under this Division connected with a general insurer and a protected policy is met, the person is taken to have been paid the amount by the general insurer under the terms and conditions of the policy.

    * (2) However, the regulations may prescribe a purpose for which a person is taken not to have been paid an amount, under the terms and conditions of a policy, by:

     * (a) a general insurer; or

     * (b) a class of general insurers; or

     * (c) all general insurers.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (1) does not affect the rights APRA has under section 62ZZL against the general insurer.

#### Division 4--Administration

##### 62ZZN  APRA to try to ensure awareness of making of claims

    * APRA must take all reasonable steps to ensure that it is made aware, as soon as practicable, of:

     * (a) the making of a claim described in section 62ZZI within the period described in paragraph 62ZZF(1)(b); and

     * (b) the time of the making of the claim.

        * Note: APRA might meet this requirement by requiring under section 62ZZP the general insurer concerned, or the liquidator of the general insurer, to inform APRA of the making of such a claim.

##### 62ZZO  Requiring assistance

    * APRA may, by written notice given to any of the following persons, require the person to give APRA such reasonable assistance in the performance of its functions, and the exercise of its powers, under this Part as is specified:

    * (2) The person specified in the requirement must be one of the following:

     * (a) APRA;

     * (b) an APRA member whose duties relate to an action described in subsection (4);

     * (c) an APRA staff member whose duties relate to an action described in subsection (4);

     * (d) a person to whom APRA has delegated a power or function under this Part that relates to an action described in subsection (4);

     * (e) a person who is an officer or employee of a person described in paragraph (d) and whose duties relate to an action described in subsection (4).

    * (3) The information specified in the requirement may be or include personal information. This does not limit the information that may be specified in the requirement.

      * Penalty: 200 penalty units.

    * (3) An offence against subsection (2) is an indictable offence.

        * Note: Section 4K (Continuing and multiple offences) of the _Crimes Act 1914_ applies to an offence against subsection (2), so a general insurer commits an offence for each day it does not comply with a requirement under subsection 62ZZP(1) (to give information within a particular time).

    * Requirement made of general insurer--offence by officer

    * (4) An officer (as defined in section 9 of the _Corporations Act 2001_) of a general insurer commits an offence if:

     * (a) the officer fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the general insurer complies with a requirement made of it under section 62ZZO or subsection 62ZZP(1); and

     * (b) the officer's duties include ensuring that the general insurer complies with the requirement.

      * Penalty: 50 penalty units.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not apply to an officer who is a liquidator (including a provisional liquidator) of the general insurer.

        * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (5): see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (6) If an officer of a general insurer fails to take reasonable steps to ensure that the general insurer complies with a requirement made of it under subsection 62ZZP(1) in circumstances that give rise to the officer committing an offence against subsection (4) of this section, the officer commits an offence against that subsection in respect of:

     * (a) the first day on which the offence is committed; and

     * (b) each subsequent day (if any) on which the circumstances that gave rise to the officer committing the offence continue (including the day of conviction for any such offence or any later day).

        * Note: This subsection does not affect the application of section 4K of the _Crimes Act 1914_ to other offences against this Act (including subsection (2)) or the regulations.

    * Liquidator to comply with requirement made of liquidator

    * (7) A liquidator (including a provisional liquidator) must comply with a requirement made of the liquidator under section 62ZZO or subsection 62ZZP(1).

      * Penalty: 100 penalty units.

        * Note: Section 4K (Continuing and multiple offences) of the _Crimes Act 1914 _applies to an offence against subsection (9), so the judicial manager commits an offence for each day that the judicial manager does not comply with a requirement under subsection 62ZZP(1).

##### 62ZZR  Obtaining further information from claimant or applicant

    * (1) If section 62ZZI or 62ZZJ requires a determination to be made because of the making of a claim or application but there is insufficient information to make the determination:

     * (a) APRA may request the claimant or applicant to give a specified person, in a specified way within a reasonable specified time, specified information relevant to the making of the determination, for the person to use in making the determination; and

##### 62ZZS  Recovery of overpayments

    * The regulations may make provision for and in relation to the recovery by APRA of the excess of an amount paid to, or applied for the benefit of, a person purportedly to meet an entitlement of the person under Division 3 over the person's entitlement (if any) under that Division.

##### 62ZZT  APRA may delegate functions and powers under this Part

    * (1) APRA may, by writing under its seal, delegate any or all of APRA's functions and powers under this Part to a person.

    * (2) In performing or exercising functions or powers delegated under subsection (1), the delegate must comply with any directions given by APRA.

    * (3) This section does not limit section 15 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_.

        * Note: Section 15 of the _Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998_:

         * (a) makes the agreement of the Chair of ASIC a condition for a delegation to an ASIC member or an ASIC staff member; and

         * (b) makes the agreement of the Governor of the Reserve Bank a condition for a delegation to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank or to an officer of the Reserve Bank Service.

##### 62ZZU  APRA's costs of administration

    * (2) The debt is admissible to proof against the declared general insurer in the winding up of the general insurer.

    * (3) The debt has the same priority in the winding up of the declared general insurer as a claim in respect of a policy issued by the insurer.

    * (4) Subsection (1) does not apply to the amounts of entitlements under Division 3.

     * (b) APRA must ensure that a notice is published in the _Gazette_ stating that the insurer is no longer allowed to carry on insurance business because of the start of the winding up.

    * (2) A general insurer doesn't contravene subsection (1) merely because it is carrying on business for the purpose of discharging liabilities assumed by it before the start of the winding up.

    * (3) In the winding up of a general insurer, the insurer's assets in Australia must not be applied in the discharge of its liabilities other than its liabilities in Australia unless it has no liabilities in Australia.

        * Note: Section 116A deals with assets and liabilities in Australia.

    * (3A) For the purposes of subsection (3), a preauthorisation liability of a general insurer is taken not to be a liability in Australia of the general insurer.

    * (4) Nothing in this section affects the validity of a contract entered into by a general insurer after it is started to be wound up.

    * (5) This section has effect and must be complied with despite anything in any law of a State or Territory.

##### 116A  Assets and liabilities in Australia

    * (1) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC and 62ZZE, an amount is taken to be an asset in Australia of a general insurer if:

     * (a) the insurer expects to recover the amount under a contract of reinsurance entered into with a person who is outside Australia; and

     * (b) the amount relates to claims in respect of liabilities in Australia of the insurer, whether or not the claims have been paid by the insurer; and

     * (c) under the terms of the contract, payments by way of reinsurance are to be made in Australia.

        * Note 1: Section 28 requires general insurers to hold sufficient assets.

        * Note 2: Section 62M provides for the appointment of a judicial manager for a foreign general insurer if its assets in Australia referred to in that section are, or are likely to become, insufficient to enable it to meet its liabilities in Australia other than preauthorisation liabilities as they become due.

        * Note 3: Sections 62ZZC and 62ZZE are concerned with APRA believing a foreign general insurer is unable to pay, from its assets in Australia referred to in those sections, all its debts that are liabilities in Australia other than preauthorisation liabilities, as and when those debts become due and payable.

    * (2) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, a liability is taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made in Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued in Australia, other than a contract:

     * (a) that relates only to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only outside Australia, not being a liability that the body corporate has undertaken to satisfy in Australia; or

     * (b) if the insurer carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia--that relates only to a liability that the insurer has undertaken to satisfy outside Australia.

        * Note: Subsection 116(3) gives priority to discharge of liabilities in Australia when a general insurer is being wound up.

    * (3) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, a liability is also taken to be a liability in Australia of a general insurer if it is undertaken by the insurer under a contract of insurance (including reinsurance) made outside Australia or in respect of which a proposal was accepted or a policy issued outside Australia, if the contract:

     * (a) relates to a liability contingent on an event that can happen only in Australia; or

     * (b) if the insurer carries on insurance business both in and outside Australia--relates to a liability that the insurer has undertaken to satisfy in Australia;

    * and any part of the negotiations or arrangements leading to the making of the contract, the acceptance of the proposal or the issue of the policy took place or were made in Australia.

    * (4) For the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC, 62ZZE and 116, unless the contrary intention appears, a reference to liabilities of a body corporate includes a reference to provision for liabilities made in its accounts, or directed in accordance with section 104 to be made, but does not include:

     * (a) a liability in respect of share capital; or

     * (b) where the body corporate is registered under section 21 of the _Life Insurance Act 1995_, a liability that is, in accordance with that Act:

      * (i) referable to a class of life insurance business carried on by the body corporate in respect of which it has established a statutory fund under that Act; or

      * (ii) charged on any of the assets of such a statutory fund.

    * (5) The whole or such part as APRA determines of an amount owed to a body corporate by way of portions of premiums retained under a contract of reinsurance by a person outside Australia is, for the purposes of sections 28, 62M, 62ZZC and 62ZZE, to be taken to be an asset in Australia of the body corporate.

    * (6) Where:

     * (a) a determination has been made under subsection (5); and

     * (b) it appears at any time to APRA that the determination is no longer necessary or should be varied;

    * APRA must, by notice in writing served on the body corporate concerned, revoke or vary the determination, as the case may be.

    * (7) Part VI applies to a decision by APRA under subsection (5) or (6) to determine an amount or to vary such a determination.

##### 117  Address for service in Australia

    * (1) A body corporate that is not incorporated in Australia and:

     * (a) is a foreign general insurer; or

    * (2) An address becomes the address for service for the insurer or subsidiary when written notice of the address is given to APRA. (The address continues to be the address for service until APRA is given written notice of another address.)

    * (3) If:

     * (a) written notice has been given to APRA of an address for service in Australia for a foreign general insurer; and

     * (b) a body corporate that is a subsidiary of the foreign general insurer is not incorporated in Australia; and

     * (c) no written notice has been given to APRA of an address for service in Australia for the subsidiary;

    * the address for service in Australia for the foreign general insurer is taken, from the time when the notice referred to in paragraph (a) was or is given, to have been, or to be, the address for service in Australia for the subsidiary for the purposes of this Act.

## Schedule 1--Civil penalties

  * Note: See section 129E.

### Part 1--Contravention of a civil penalty provision

##### 1  Federal Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty for contravening civil penalty provision

    * Application for order

    * (1) Within 6 years of a person contravening a civil penalty provision, APRA may apply, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to the Federal Court for an order that the person pay the Commonwealth a pecuniary penalty.

    * Court may order person to pay pecuniary penalty

    * (2) If the Court is satisfied that the person has contravened a civil penalty provision, the Court may order the person to pay to the Commonwealth for each contravention the pecuniary penalty that the Court determines is appropriate (but not more than the relevant amount specified for the provision).

    * Determining amount of pecuniary penalty

    * (3) In determining the pecuniary penalty, the Court must have regard to all relevant matters, including:

     * (a) the nature and extent of the contravention; and

     * (b) the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered as a result of the contravention; and

     * (c) the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and

     * (d) whether the person has previously been found by the Court in proceedings under this Act to have engaged in any similar conduct.

    * Conduct contravening more than one civil penalty provision

    * (4) If conduct constitutes a contravention of 2 or more civil penalty provisions, proceedings may be instituted under this Act against a person in relation to the contravention of any one or more of those provisions. However, the person is not liable to more than one pecuniary penalty under this clause in respect of the same conduct.

##### 2  Contravening a civil penalty provision is not an offence

    * A contravention of a civil penalty provision is not an offence.

##### 3  Persons involved in contravening civil penalty provision

    * (1) A person must not:

     * (a) aid, abet, counsel or procure a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

     * (b) induce (by threats, promises or otherwise) a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

     * (c) be in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in, or party to, a contravention of a civil penalty provision; or

     * (d) conspire to contravene a civil penalty provision.

    * (2) This Schedule applies to a person who contravenes subclause (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision as if the person had contravened the provision.

    * (3) However, if an individual contravenes subclause (1) in relation to a civil penalty provision that can be contravened only by a body corporate, subclause 1(2) applies as if the reference in that subclause to the relevant amount specified for the provision were a reference to 1/5 of the relevant amount specified for the provision.

##### 4  Recovery of a pecuniary penalty

    * If the Federal Court orders a person to pay a pecuniary penalty: 

     * (a) the penalty is payable to the Commonwealth; and

     * (b) the Commonwealth may enforce the order as if it were a judgment of the Court.

##### 5  Civil evidence and procedure rules for pecuniary penalty orders

    * The Federal Court must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters when hearing proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order.

### Part 2--Civil penalty proceedings and criminal proceedings

##### 6  Civil proceedings after criminal proceedings

    * The Federal Court must not make a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision if the person has been convicted of an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct constituting the contravention.

##### 7  Criminal proceedings during civil proceedings

    * (1) Proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against a person for a contravention of a civil penalty provision are stayed if:

     * (a) criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the person for an offence; and

     * (b) the offence is constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the conduct alleged to constitute the contravention.

    * (2) The proceedings for the order may be resumed if the person is not convicted of the offence. Otherwise, the proceedings for the order are dismissed.

##### 8  Criminal proceedings after civil proceedings

    * Criminal proceedings may be started against a person for conduct that is substantially the same as conduct constituting a contravention of a civil penalty provision regardless of whether a pecuniary penalty order has been made against the person.

##### 9  Evidence given in proceedings for penalty not admissible in criminal proceedings

    * Evidence of information given or evidence of production of documents by an individual is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the individual if: 

     * (a) the individual previously gave the evidence or produced the documents in proceedings for a pecuniary penalty order against the individual for a contravention of a civil penalty provision (whether or not the order was made); and

     * (b) the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the conduct that was claimed to constitute the contravention.

    * However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence given by the individual in the proceedings for the pecuniary penalty order.
