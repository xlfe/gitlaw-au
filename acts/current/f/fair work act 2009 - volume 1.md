#### Division 2--Object of this Act

##### 3  Object of this Act

    * The object of this Act is to provide a balanced framework for cooperative and productive workplace relations that promotes national economic prosperity and social inclusion for all Australians by: 

     * (a) providing workplace relations laws that are fair to working Australians, are flexible for businesses, promote productivity and economic growth for Australia's future economic prosperity and take into account Australia's international labour obligations; and

     * (b) ensuring a guaranteed safety net of fair, relevant and enforceable minimum terms and conditions through the National Employment Standards, modern awards and national minimum wage orders; and

     * (c) ensuring that the guaranteed safety net of fair, relevant and enforceable minimum wages and conditions can no longer be undermined by the making of statutory individual employment agreements of any kind given that such agreements can never be part of a fair workplace relations system; and

     * (d) assisting employees to balance their work and family responsibilities by providing for flexible working arrangements; and

     * (e) enabling fairness and representation at work and the prevention of discrimination by recognising the right to freedom of association and the right to be represented, protecting against unfair treatment and discrimination, providing accessible and effective procedures to resolve grievances and disputes and providing effective compliance mechanisms; and

     * (f) achieving productivity and fairness through an emphasis on enterpriselevel collective bargaining underpinned by simple good faith bargaining obligations and clear rules governing industrial action; and

     * (g) acknowledging the special circumstances of small and mediumsized businesses.

##### 5  Terms and conditions of employment (Chapter 2)

    * (1) Chapter 2 provides for terms and conditions of employment of national system employees.

        * Note: Workplace determinations are another source of main terms and conditions. In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279).

    * Main terms and conditions

    * (3) Part 22 contains the National Employment Standards, which are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.

    * (4) Part 23 is about modern awards. A modern award is made for a particular industry or occupation and provides additional minimum terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. A modern award can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

    * (5) Part 24 is about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

    * (6) Part 25 is about workplace determinations. A workplace determination provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. A workplace determination is made by the FWC if certain conditions are met.

    * (7) Part 28 provides for the transfer of certain modern awards, enterprise agreements, workplace determinations and other instruments if there is a transfer of business from one national system employer to another national system employer.

     * (a) provided by a national minimum wage order (see Part 26) or an equal remuneration order (see Part 27); and

No action lies under any law in force in a State or Territory in relation to protected industrial action except in certain circumstances.

    * (5) Part 34 is about the rights of officials of organisations who hold entry permits to enter premises for purposes related to their representative role under this Act and under State or Territory OHS laws. In exercising those rights, permit holders must comply with the requirements set out in the Part.

    * (6) Part 35 allows a national system employer to stand down a national system employee without pay in certain circumstances.

          * (b) if an employee receives notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice in relation to a period of service with the first employer, that period of service is not counted again in calculating the amount of notice of termination, or payment in lieu, to which the employee is entitled as an employee of the second employer.

## Chapter 2--Terms and conditions of employment

### Part 21--Core provisions for this Chapter

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 41  Guide to this Part

    * This Part has the core provisions for this Chapter, which deals with terms and conditions of employment of national system employees. The main terms and conditions come from the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations.

    * The National Employment Standards (Part 22) are minimum terms and conditions that apply to all national system employees.

    * A modern award (see Part 23), an enterprise agreement (see Part 24) or a workplace determination (see Part 25) provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom the award, agreement or determination applies. Only one of those instruments can apply to an employee at a particular time.

    * Division 2 has the provisions to enforce the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements. It also sets out when a modern award or enterprise agreement applies to a person and the significance of that for this Act.

           * Note: In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). For the rules about workplace determinations, see Part 25.

    * Division 3 deals with the interaction between the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.

##### 42  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer _**means a national system employer.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

#### Division 2--Core provisions for this Chapter

    * Main terms and conditions

    * (1) The main terms and conditions of employment of an employee that are provided under this Act are those set out in:

     * (a) the National Employment Standards (see Part 22); and

     * (b) a modern award (see Part 23), an enterprise agreement (see Part 24) or a workplace determination (see Part 25) that applies to the employee.

        * Note 1: The situations in which a workplace determination, rather than a modern award or enterprise agreement, provides an employee's terms and conditions of employment are limited. In most cases, this Act applies to a workplace determination as if it were an enterprise agreement in operation (see section 279). See Part 25 generally for the rules on workplace determinations.

        * Note 2: Part 28 provides for the transfer of certain modern awards, enterprise agreements and workplace determinations if there is a transfer of business from an employee's employer to another employer.

        * Note 3: Copied State instruments provide the main terms and conditions of employment for an employee to whom the instrument applies. See Part 63A generally for the rules about those instruments.

    * Other terms and conditions

    * (2) In addition, other terms and conditions of employment include:

     * (a) those terms and conditions arising from:

      * (i) a national minimum wage order (see Part 26); or

        * Note 1: Subsections 65(5) and 76(4) state that an employer may refuse a request for flexible working arrangements, or an application to extend unpaid parental leave, only on reasonable business grounds.

        * Note 2: Modern awards and enterprise agreements include terms about settling disputes in relation to the National Employment Standards (other than disputes as to whether an employer had reasonable business grounds under subsection 65(5) or 76(4)).

##### Subdivision A--Interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or an enterprise agreement

##### 55  Interaction between the National Employment Standards and a modern award or enterprise agreement

    * National Employment Standards must not be excluded

    * (1) A modern award or enterprise agreement must not exclude the National Employment Standards or any provision of the National Employment Standards.

    * Terms expressly permitted by Part 22 or regulations may be included

    * (2) A modern award or enterprise agreement may include any terms that the award or agreement is expressly permitted to include:

     * (a) by a provision of Part 22 (which deals with the National Employment Standards); or

     * (b) by regulations made for the purposes of section 127.

        * Note: In determining what is permitted to be included in a modern award or enterprise agreement by a provision referred to in paragraph (a), any regulations made for the purpose of section 127 that expressly prohibit certain terms must be taken into account.

    * (3) The National Employment Standards have effect subject to terms included in a modern award or enterprise agreement as referred to in subsection (2).

        * Note: See also the note to section 63 (which deals with the effect of averaging arrangements).

    * Ancillary and supplementary terms may be included

    * (4) A modern award or enterprise agreement may also include the following kinds of terms:

     * (a) terms that are ancillary or incidental to the operation of an entitlement of an employee under the National Employment Standards;

     * (b) terms that supplement the National Employment Standards;

    * but only to the extent that the effect of those terms is not detrimental to an employee in any respect, when compared to the National Employment Standards.

        * Note 1: Ancillary or incidental terms permitted by paragraph (a) include (for example) terms:

          * (a) under which, instead of taking paid annual leave at the rate of pay required by section 90, an employee may take twice as much leave at half that rate of pay; or

          * (b) that specify when payment under section 90 for paid annual leave must be made.

        * Note 2: Supplementary terms permitted by paragraph (b) include (for example) terms:

          * (a) that increase the amount of paid annual leave to which an employee is entitled beyond the number of weeks that applies under section 87; or

          * (b) that provide for an employee to be paid for taking a period of paid annual leave or paid/personal carer's leave at a rate of pay that is higher than the employee's base rate of pay (which is the rate required by sections 90 and 99).

        * Note 3: Terms that would not be permitted by paragraph (a) or (b) include (for example) terms requiring an employee to give more notice of the taking of unpaid parental leave than is required by section 74.

    *  agreements may include terms that have the same effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards

    * (5) An enterprise agreement may include terms that have the same (or substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards, whether or not ancillary or supplementary terms are included as referred to in subsection (4).

    * Effect of terms that give an employee the same entitlement as under the National Employment Standards

    * (6) To avoid doubt, if a modern award includes terms permitted by subsection (4), or an enterprise agreement includes terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5), then, to the extent that the terms give an employee an entitlement (the **_award or agreement entitlement_**) that is the same as an entitlement (the **_NES entitlement_**) of the employee under the National Employment Standards:

     * (a) those terms operate in parallel with the employee's NES entitlement, but not so as to give the employee a double benefit; and

     * (b) the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the NES entitlement apply, as a minimum standard, to the award or agreement entitlement.

        * Note: For example, if the award or agreement entitlement is to 6 weeks of paid annual leave per year, the provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to the accrual and taking of paid annual leave will apply, as a minimum standard, to 4 weeks of that leave.

    * Terms permitted by subsection (4) or (5) do not contravene subsection (1)

    * (7) To the extent that a term of a modern award or enterprise agreement is permitted by subsection (4) or (5), the term does not contravene subsection (1).

        * Note: A term of a modern award has no effect to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56). An enterprise agreement that includes a term that contravenes this section must not be approved (see section 186) and a term of an enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes this section (see section 56).

##### 56  Terms of a modern award or enterprise agreement contravening section 55 have no effect

    * A term of a modern award or enterprise agreement has no effect to the extent that it contravenes section 55.

##### Subdivision B--Interaction between modern awards and enterprise agreements

##### 57  Interaction between modern awards and enterprise agreements

    * (1) A modern award does not apply to an employee in relation to particular employment at a time when an enterprise agreement applies to the employee in relation to that employment.

    * (2) If a modern award does not apply to an employee in relation to particular employment because of subsection (1), the award does not apply to an employer, or an employee organisation, in relation to the employee.

##### 57A  Designated outworker terms of a modern award continue to apply

    * (1) This section applies if, at a particular time:

     * (a) an enterprise agreement applies to an employer; and

     * (b) a modern award covers the employer (whether the modern award covers the employer in the employer's capacity as an employer or an outworker entity); and

     * (c) the modern award includes one or more designated outworker terms.

    * (2) Despite section 57, the designated outworker terms of the modern award apply at that time to the following:

     * (a) the employer;

     * (b) each employee who is both:

      * (i) a person to whom the enterprise agreement applies; and

      * (ii) a person who is covered by the modern award;

     * (c) each employee organisation that is covered by the modern award.

    * (3) To avoid doubt:

     * (a) designated outworker terms of a modern award can apply to an employer under subsection (2) even if none of the employees of the employer is an outworker; and

     * (b) to the extent to which designated outworker terms of a modern award apply to an employer, an employee or an employee organisation because of subsection (2), the modern award applies to the employer, employee or organisation.

##### Subdivision C--Interaction between one or more enterprise agreements

##### 58  Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee

    * Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee

    * (1) Only one enterprise agreement can apply to an employee at a particular time.

    * General rule--later agreement does not apply until earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date

    * (2) If:

     * (a) an enterprise agreement (the **_earlier agreement_**) applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

     * (b) another enterprise agreement (the **_later agreement_**) that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation; and

     * (c) subsection (3) (which deals with a singleenterprise agreement replacing a multienterprise agreement) does not apply;

    * then: 

     * (d) if the earlier agreement has not passed its nominal expiry date:

      * (i) the later agreement cannot apply to the employee in relation to that employment until the earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date; and

      * (ii) the earlier agreement ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment when the earlier agreement passes its nominal expiry date, and can never so apply again; or

     * (e) if the earlier agreement has passed its nominal expiry date--the earlier agreement ceases to apply to the employee when the later agreement comes into operation, and can never so apply again.

    * Special rule--singleenterprise agreement replaces multienterprise agreement

    * (3) Despite subsection (2), if:

     * (a) a multienterprise agreement applies to an employee in relation to particular employment; and

     * (b) a singleenterprise agreement that covers the employee in relation to the same employment comes into operation;

    * the multienterprise agreement ceases to apply to the employee in relation to that employment when the singleenterprise agreement comes into operation, and can never so apply again.

### Part 22--The National Employment Standards

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 59  Guide to this Part

    * This Part contains the National Employment Standards.

    * Division 2 identifies the National Employment Standards, the detail of which is set out in Divisions 3 to 12.

    * Division 13 contains miscellaneous provisions relating to the National Employment Standards.

    * The National Employment Standards are minimum standards that apply to the employment of national system employees. Part 21 (which deals with the core provisions for this Chapter) contains the obligation for employers to comply with the National Employment Standards (see section 44).

    * The National Employment Standards also underpin what can be included in modern awards and enterprise agreements. Part 21 provides that the National Employment Standards cannot be excluded by modern awards or enterprise agreements, and contains other provisions about the interaction between the National Employment Standards and modern awards or enterprise agreements (see sections 55 and 56).

    * Divisions 2 and 3 of Part 63 extend the operation of the parental leave and notice of termination provisions of the National Employment Standards to employees who are not national system employees.

##### 60  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

#### Division 2--The National Employment Standards

##### 61  The National Employment Standards are minimum standards applying to employment of employees

    * (1) This Part sets minimum standards that apply to the employment of employees which cannot be displaced, even if an enterprise agreement includes terms of the kind referred to in subsection 55(5).

        * Note: Subsection 55(5) allows enterprise agreements to include terms that have the same (or substantially the same) effect as provisions of the National Employment Standards.

    * (2) The minimum standards relate to the following matters:

     * (a) maximum weekly hours (Division 3);

     * (b) requests for flexible working arrangements (Division 4);

     * (c) parental leave and related entitlements (Division 5);

     * (d) annual leave (Division 6);

     * (e) personal/carer's leave and compassionate leave (Division 7);

     * (f) community service leave (Division 8);

     * (g) long service leave (Division 9);

     * (h) public holidays (Division 10);

     * (i) notice of termination and redundancy pay (Division 11);

     * (j) Fair Work Information Statement (Division 12).

    * (3) Divisions 3 to 12 constitute the **_National Employment Standards_**.

##### 64  Averaging of hours of work for award/agreement free employees

    * (1) An employer and an award/agreement free employee may agree in writing to an averaging arrangement under which hours of work over a specified period of not more than 26 weeks are averaged. The average weekly hours over the specified period must not exceed:

     * (a) is an exception to the rule that the employee must take her unpaid parental leave in a single continuous period (see subsection 71(2) or 72(2)); and

     * (b) is an exception to the rules about when the employee's period of unpaid parental leave must start (see subsections 71(3) and (6), or subsection 72(3)).

        * Note: The period of leave is unpaid parental leave and so comes out of the employee's entitlement to 12 months of unpaid parental leave under section 70.

    * (5) The employee is not required to comply with section 74 in relation to the period of leave.

##### 74  Notice and evidence requirements

    * Notice

     * (a) at least:

      * (i) 10 weeks before starting the leave, unless subparagraph (ii) applies; or

      * (ii) if the leave is to be taken in separate periods of concurrent leave (see paragraph 72(5)(b)) and the leave is not the first of those periods of concurrent leave--4 weeks before starting the period of concurrent leave; or

     * (a) if the leave is birthrelated leave--of the date of birth, or the expected date of birth, of the child; or

     * (b) if the leave is adoptionrelated leave:

      * (i) of the day of placement, or the expected day of placement, of the child; and

##### 75  Extending period of unpaid parental leave--extending to use more of available parental leave period

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an employee has, in accordance with section 74, given notice of the taking of a period of unpaid parental leave (the **_original leave period_**); and

     * (b) the original leave period is less than the employee's available parental leave period; and

     * (c) the original leave period has started.

    * (2) The employee's **_available parental leave period_** is 12 months, less any periods of the following kinds:

     * (a) a period of concurrent leave that the employee has taken in accordance with subsection 72(5);

     * (b) a period of unpaid parental leave that the employee has been required to take under subsection 73(2) or 82(2);

    * Further extensions by agreement with employer

    * (5) If the employer agrees, the employee may further extend the period of unpaid parental leave one or more times.

    * No entitlement to extension beyond available parental leave period

    * (1) An employee who takes unpaid parental leave for his or her available parental leave period may request his or her employer to agree to an extension of unpaid parental leave for the employee for a further period of up to 12 months immediately following the end of the available parental leave period.

    * Agreeing to the requested extension

    * (3) The employer must give the employee a written response to the request stating whether the employer grants or refuses the request. The response must be given as soon as practicable, and not later than 21 days, after the request is made.

    * (4) The employer may refuse the request only on reasonable business grounds.

    * (5) If the employer refuses the request, the written response under subsection (3) must include details of the reasons for the refusal.

    * Special rules for employee couples

    * (6) The following paragraphs apply in relation to a member of an employee couple extending a period of unpaid parental leave in relation to a child under this section:

     * (a) the request must specify any amount of unpaid parental leave that the other member of the employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts;

     * (b) the period of the extension cannot exceed 12 months, less any period of unpaid parental leave that the other member of the employee couple has taken, or will have taken, in relation to the child before the extension starts;

     * (c) the amount of unpaid parental leave to which the other member of the employee couple is entitled under section 70 in relation to the child is reduced by the period of the extension.

##### 77  Reducing period of unpaid parental leave

    * If the employer agrees, an employee whose period of unpaid parental leave has started may reduce the period of unpaid parental leave he or she takes.

##### 77A  Pregnancy ends (other than by birth of a living child) or child born alive dies

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies to unpaid parental leave, if:

     * (a) the leave is birthrelated leave; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive; or

      * (ii) the child dies after being born.

    * Cancellation of leave

    * (2) Before the leave starts:

     * (a) the employee may give the employer written notice cancelling the leave; or

     * (b) the employer may give the employee written notice cancelling the leave.

        * Example: Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if:

          * (a) the child dies after being born; and

          * (b) the employee is the female employee who gave birth to the child.

        * This is because in this case the leave must not start later than the date of birth of the child (see subsection 71(3)).

    * (3) If the employee or employer does so, the employee is not entitled to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child.

        * Note: If the employee is the female employee who was pregnant with the child and the employee is not fit for work, she may be entitled to:

          * (a) paid personal leave under Subdivision A of Division 7; or

          * (b) unpaid special maternity leave under section 80.

    * Return to work

    * (4) The employee may give the employer written notice that the employee wishes to return to work:

     * (a) after the start of the period of leave, but before its end; and

     * (b) within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice.

    * (5) The employer:

     * (a) may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day; and

     * (b) must do so if the employee gives the employer written notice under subsection (4);

    * unless the leave has not started and the employer cancels it under subsection (2).

    * (6) The specified day must be after the start of the period of leave, and:

     * (a) if subsection (4) applies--within 4 weeks after the employer receives the notice under that subsection; or

     * (b) otherwise--at least 6 weeks after the notice is given to the employee under subsection (5).

    * (7) The employee's entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.

    * Interaction with section 77

    * (8) This section does not limit section 77 (which deals with the employee ending the period of unpaid parental leave with the agreement of the employer).

##### 78  Employee who ceases to have responsibility for care of child

    * (1) This section applies to an employee who has taken unpaid parental leave in relation to a child if the employee ceases to have any responsibility for the care of the child.

    * (1A) However, this section does not apply if section 77A applies to the unpaid parental leave (because the unpaid parental leave is birthrelated leave and either the pregnancy ends other than by the child being born alive or the child dies after being born).

    * (2) The employer may give the employee written notice requiring the employee to return to work on a specified day.

    * (3) The specified day:

     * (a) must be at least 4 weeks after the notice is given to the employee; and

     * (b) if the leave is birthrelated leave taken by a female employee who has given birth--must not be earlier than 6 weeks after the date of birth of the child.

    * (4) The employee's entitlement to unpaid parental leave in relation to the child ends immediately before the specified day.

##### 79  Interaction with paid leave

    * (1) This Subdivision (except for subsections (2) and (3)) does not prevent an employee from taking any other kind of paid leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does so, the taking of that other paid leave does not break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.

        * Note: For example, if the employee has paid annual leave available, he or she may (with the employer's agreement) take some or all of that paid annual leave at the same time as the unpaid parental leave.

    * (2) An employee is not entitled to take paid personal/carer's leave or compassionate leave while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave.

    * (3) An employee is not entitled to any payment under Division 8 (which deals with community service leave) in relation to activities the employee engages in while taking unpaid parental leave.

##### 79A  Keeping in touch days

    * (1) This Subdivision does not prevent an employee from performing work for his or her employer on a keeping in touch day while he or she is taking unpaid parental leave. If the employee does so, the performance of that work does not break the continuity of the period of unpaid parental leave.

    * (2) A day on which the employee performs work for the employer during the period of leave is a **_keeping in touch day_** if:

     * (a) the purpose of performing the work is to enable the employee to keep in touch with his or her employment in order to facilitate a return to that employment after the end of the period of leave; and

     * (b) both the employee and the employer consent to the employee performing work for the employer on that day; and

     * (c) the day is not within:

      * (i) if the employee suggested or requested that he or she perform work for the employer on that day--14 days after the date of birth, or day of placement, of the child to which the period of leave relates; or

      * (ii) otherwise--42 days after the date of birth, or day of placement, of the child; and

     * (d) the employee has not already performed work for the employer or another entity on 10 days during the period of leave that were keeping in touch days.

    * The duration of the work the employee performs on that day is not relevant for the purposes of this subsection.

        * Note: The employer will be obliged, under the relevant contract of employment or industrial instrument, to pay the employee for performing work on a keeping in touch day.

    * (3) The employee's decision whether to give the consent mentioned in paragraph (2)(b) is taken, for the purposes of section 344 (which deals with undue influence or pressure), to be a decision to make, or not make, an arrangement under the National Employment Standards.

    * (4) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(d), treat as 2 separate periods of unpaid parental leave:

     * (a) a period of unpaid parental leave taken during the employee's available parental leave period; and

     * (b) a period of unpaid parental leave taken as an extension of the leave referred to in paragraph (a) for a further period immediately following the end of the available parental leave period.

        * Note: Performance of work on keeping in touch days is also dealt with, for the purposes of parental leave pay, in sections 49 and 50 of the _Paid Parental Leave Act 2010_.

##### 79B  Unpaid parental leave not extended by paid leave or keeping in touch days

    * If, during a period of unpaid parental leave, an employee:

     * (a) takes paid leave; or

     * (b) performs work for his or her employer on a keeping in touch day;

    * taking that leave or performing that work does not have the effect of extending the period of unpaid parental leave.

##### Subdivision C--Other entitlements

##### 80  Unpaid special maternity leave

    * Entitlement to unpaid special maternity leave

    * (1) A female employee is entitled to a period of unpaid special maternity leave if she is not fit for work during that period because:

     * (a) she has a pregnancyrelated illness; or

     * (b) she has been pregnant, and the pregnancy ends within 28 weeks of the expected date of birth of the child otherwise than by the birth of a living child.

        * Note 1: Entitlement is also affected by section 67 (which deals with the length of the employee's service).

        * Note 2: If a female employee has an entitlement to paid personal/carer's leave (see section 96), she may take that leave instead of taking unpaid special maternity leave under this section.

    * Notice and evidence

    * (2) An employee must give her employer notice of the taking of unpaid special maternity leave by the employee.

    * (3) The notice:

     * (a) must be given to the employer as soon as practicable (which may be a time after the leave has started); and

     * (b) must advise the employer of the period, or expected period, of the leave.

    * (4) An employee who has given her employer notice of the taking of unpaid special maternity leave must, if required by the employer, give the employer evidence that would satisfy a reasonable person that the leave is taken for a reason specified in subsection (1).

    * (6) An employee is not entitled to take unpaid special maternity leave unless the employee complies with subsections (2) to (4).

    * (3) An **_appropriate safe job_** is a safe job that has:

     * (a) the same ordinary hours of work as the employee's present position; or

     * (b) a different number of ordinary hours agreed to by the employee.

    * (4) If the employee is transferred to an appropriate safe job for the risk period, the employer must pay the employee for the safe job at the employee's full rate of pay (for the position she was in before the transfer) for the hours that she works in the risk period.

    * (5) If the employee's pregnancy ends before the end of the risk period, the **_risk period_** ends when the pregnancy ends.

    * (6) Without limiting subsection (1), an employer may require the evidence to be a medical certificate.

     * (a) section 81 applies to a pregnant employee but there is no appropriate safe job available; and

     * (b) the employee is entitled to unpaid parental leave; and

     * (c) the employee has complied with the notice and evidence requirements of section 74 for taking unpaid parental leave;

    * then the employee is entitled to paid no safe job leave for the risk period.

    * (2) If the employee takes paid no safe job leave for the risk period, the employer must pay the employee at the employee's base rate of pay for the employee's ordinary hours of work in the risk period.

##### 82  Employee on paid no safe job leave may be asked to provide a further medical certificate

    * Employer may ask employee to provide a medical certificate

    * (1) If an employee is on paid no safe job leave during the 6 week period before the expected date of birth of the child, the employer may ask the employee to give the employer a medical certificate stating whether the employee is fit for work.

        * Note: Personal information given to an employer under this subsection may be regulated under the _Privacy Act 1988_.

    * Employer may require employee to take unpaid parental leave

    * (2) The employer may require the employee to take a period of unpaid parental leave (the **_period of leave_**) as soon as practicable if:

     * (a) the employee does not give the employer the requested certificate within 7 days after the request; or

     * (b) within 7 days after the request, the employee gives the employer a certificate stating that the employee is not fit for work.

##### Subdivision A--Notice of termination or payment in lieu of notice

##### 117  Requirement for notice of termination or payment in lieu

    * Notice specifying day of termination

        * Note 1: Section 123 describes situations in which this section does not apply.

        * Note 2: Sections 28A and 29 of the _Acts Interpretation Act 1901_ provide how a notice may be given. In particular, the notice may be given to an employee by:

          * (c) sending it by prepaid post to the employee's last known address.

    * Amount of notice or payment in lieu of notice

    * (2) The employer must not terminate the employee's employment unless:

     * (a) the time between giving the notice and the day of the termination is at least the period (the **_minimum period of notice_**) worked out under subsection (3); or

     * (b) the employer has paid to the employee (or to another person on the employee's behalf) payment in lieu of notice of at least the amount the employer would have been liable to pay to the employee (or to another person on the employee's behalf) at the full rate of pay for the hours the employee would have worked had the employment continued until the end of the minimum period of notice.

    * (3) Work out the minimum period of notice as follows:

     * (a) first, work out the period using the following table:

     * (b) then increase the period by 1 week if the employee is over 45 years old and has completed at least 2 years of continuous service with the employer at the end of the day the notice is given.

##### 118  Modern awards and enterprise agreements may provide for notice of termination by employees

    * A modern award or enterprise agreement may include terms specifying the period of notice an employee must give in order to terminate his or her employment.

##### Subdivision B--Redundancy pay

    * Entitlement to redundancy pay

    * (1) An employee is entitled to be paid redundancy pay by the employer if the employee's employment is terminated:

     * (a) at the employer's initiative because the employer no longer requires the job done by the employee to be done by anyone, except where this is due to the ordinary and customary turnover of labour; or

     * (b) because of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer.

        * Note: Sections 121, 122 and 123 describe situations in which the employee does not have this entitlement.

    * Amount of redundancy pay

    * (2) The amount of the redundancy pay equals the total amount payable to the employee for the redundancy pay period worked out using the following table at the employee's base rate of pay for his or her ordinary hours of work:

##### 120  Variation of redundancy pay for other employment or incapacity to pay

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) an employee is entitled to be paid an amount of redundancy pay by the employer because of section 119; and

     * (b) the employer:

      * (i) obtains other acceptable employment for the employee; or

      * (ii) cannot pay the amount.

    * (2) On application by the employer, the FWC may determine that the amount of redundancy pay is reduced to a specified amount (which may be nil) that the FWC considers appropriate.

    * (3) The amount of redundancy pay to which the employee is entitled under section 119 is the reduced amount specified in the determination.

##### 121  Exclusions from obligation to pay redundancy pay

    * (1) Section 119 does not apply to the termination of an employee's employment if, immediately before the time of the termination, or at the time when the person was given notice of the termination as described in subsection 117(1) (whichever happened first):

     * (a) the employee's period of continuous service with the employer is less than 12 months; or

     * (b) the employer is a small business employer.

    * (2) A modern award may include a term specifying other situations in which section 119 does not apply to the termination of an employee's employment.

    * (3) If a modern award that is in operation includes such a term (the **_award term_**), an enterprise agreement may:

     * (a) incorporate the award term by reference (and as in force from time to time) into the enterprise agreement; and

     * (b) provide that the incorporated term covers some or all of the employees who are also covered by the award term.

##### 122  Transfer of employment situations that affect the obligation to pay redundancy pay

    * Transfer of employment situation in which employer may decide not to recognise employee's service with first employer

    * (1) Subsection 22(5) does not apply (for the purpose of this Subdivision) to a transfer of employment between nonassociated entities in relation to an employee if the second employer decides not to recognise the employee's service with the first employer (for the purpose of this Subdivision).

    * Employee is not entitled to redundancy pay if service with first employer counts as service with second employer

    * (2) If subsection 22(5) applies (for the purpose of this Subdivision) to a transfer of employment in relation to an employee, the employee is not entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 in relation to the termination of his or her employment with the first employer.

        * Note: Subsection 22(5) provides that, generally, if there is a transfer of employment, service with the first employer counts as service with the second employer.

    * Employee not entitled to redundancy pay if refuses employment in certain circumstances

    * (3) An employee is not entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 in relation to the termination of his or her employment with an employer (the **_first employer_**) if:

     * (a) the employee rejects an offer of employment made by another employer (the **_second employer_**) that:

      * (i) is on terms and conditions substantially similar to, and, considered on an overall basis, no less favourable than, the employee's terms and conditions of employment with the first employer immediately before the termination; and

      * (ii) recognises the employee's service with the first employer, for the purpose of this Subdivision; and

     * (b) had the employee accepted the offer, there would have been a transfer of employment in relation to the employee.

    * (4) If the FWC is satisfied that subsection (3) operates unfairly to the employee, the FWC may order the first employer to pay the employee a specified amount of redundancy pay (not exceeding the amount that would be payable but for subsection (3)) that the FWC considers appropriate. The first employer must pay the employee that amount of redundancy pay.

### Part 23--Modern awards

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 132  Guide to this Part

    * This Part provides for the FWC to make, vary and revoke modern awards. Modern awards may set minimum terms and conditions for national system employees in particular industries or occupations. Modern awards can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards (see Part 21).

    * Division 2 provides for the modern awards objective. This requires the FWC to ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account certain social and economic factors. Division 2 also contains special provisions about modern award minimum wages.

    * Division 3 deals with the terms of modern awards.

    * Division 4 provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of modern awards (other than in relation to default fund terms of modern awards).

    * Division 4A provides for the FWC to conduct 4 yearly reviews of default fund terms of modern awards.

    * It also sets out the process for making the Schedule of Approved Employer MySuper products in a 4 yearly review, and amending the schedule after it is made to include other employer MySuper products. If an employer MySuper product is on the schedule, an employer covered by a modern award can make contributions, for the benefit of a default fund employee, to a superannuation fund that offers the product (see subsection 149D(1A)).

    * Division 5 provides for the FWC to exercise modern award powers outside the system of 4 yearly reviews in certain circumstances.

    * Division 6 contains some general provisions relating to modern award powers.

    * Division 7 contains additional provisions relating to modern enterprise awards.

    * Division 8 contains additional provisions relating to State reference public sector modern awards.

    * The obligation to comply with a modern award is in section 45 (in Part 21).

    * In relation to minimum wages in modern awards, the FWC has powers both under this Part and under Part 26 (which deals with minimum wages). The following is a summary of the FWC's powers under the 2 Parts:

     * (a) the initial making of a modern award setting modern award minimum wages can only occur under this Part;

     * (b) the main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 26;

     * (c) modern award minimum wages can also be varied under this Part, but only for work value reasons or in other limited circumstances;

     * (d) modern award minimum wages can be set (otherwise than in the initial making of a modern award) or revoked either under this Part or in annual wage reviews under Part 26.

##### 133  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

#### Division 2--Overarching provisions

##### 134  The modern awards objective

    * What is the modern awards objective?

    * (1) The FWC must ensure that modern awards, together with the National Employment Standards, provide a fair and relevant minimum safety net of terms and conditions, taking into account:

     * (a) relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and

     * (b) the need to encourage collective bargaining; and

     * (c) the need to promote social inclusion through increased workforce participation; and

     * (d) the need to promote flexible modern work practices and the efficient and productive performance of work; and

     * (da) the need to provide additional remuneration for:

      * (i) employees working overtime; or

      * (ii) employees working unsocial, irregular or unpredictable hours; or

      * (iii) employees working on weekends or public holidays; or

      * (iv) employees working shifts; and

     * (e) the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value; and

     * (f) the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on business, including on productivity, employment costs and the regulatory burden; and

     * (g) the need to ensure a simple, easy to understand, stable and sustainable modern award system for Australia that avoids unnecessary overlap of modern awards; and

     * (h) the likely impact of any exercise of modern award powers on employment growth, inflation and the sustainability, performance and competitiveness of the national economy.

    * This is the **_modern awards objective_**.

    * When does the modern awards objective apply?

    * (2) The modern awards objective applies to the performance or exercise of the FWC's **_modern award powers_**, which are:

     * (a) the FWC's functions or powers under this Part; and

     * (b) the FWC's functions or powers under Part 26, so far as they relate to modern award minimum wages.

        * Note: The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the minimum wages objective also applies (see section 284).

##### 135  Special provisions relating to modern award minimum wages

    * (1) Modern award minimum wages cannot be varied under this Part except as follows:

     * (a) modern award minimum wages can be varied if the FWC is satisfied that the variation is justified by work value reasons (see subsections 156(3) and 157(2));

     * (b) modern award minimum wages can be varied under section 160 (which deals with variation to remove ambiguities or correct errors) or section 161 (which deals with variation on referral by the Australian Human Rights Commission).

        * Note 1: The main power to vary modern award minimum wages is in annual wage reviews under Part 26. Modern award minimum wages can also be set or revoked in annual wage reviews.

        * Note 2: For the meanings of **_modern award minimum wages_**, and **_setting_** and **_varying_** such wages, see section 284.

    * (2) In exercising its powers under this Part to set, vary or revoke modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take into account the rate of the national minimum wage as currently set in a national minimum wage order.

### Part 24--Enterprise agreements

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 169  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about enterprise agreements. An enterprise agreement is made at the enterprise level and provides terms and conditions for those national system employees to whom it applies. An enterprise agreement can have terms that are ancillary or supplementary to the National Employment Standards.

    * Division 2 deals with the making of enterprise agreements about permitted matters. An enterprise agreement (including a greenfields agreement) may be a singleenterprise agreement or a multienterprise agreement.

    * Division 3 deals with the right of employees to be represented by a bargaining representative during bargaining for a proposed enterprise agreement. It also sets out the persons who are bargaining representatives for such agreements.

    * Subdivision A of Division 4 deals with the approval of proposed enterprise agreements by employees and sets out when an enterprise agreement is made.

    * Subdivision B of Division 4 deals with the approval of enterprise agreements by the FWC. The remaining Subdivisions of the Division deal with certain approval requirements, including in relation to genuine agreement by employees and the better off overall test.

    * Division 5 deals with the mandatory terms of enterprise agreements relating to individual flexibility arrangements and consultation requirements. 

    * Division 6 deals with the base rate of pay under an enterprise agreement.

    * Division 7 deals with the variation and termination of enterprise agreements.

    * Division 8 provides for the FWC to facilitate bargaining by making bargaining orders, serious breach declarations, majority support determinations and scope orders. It also permits bargaining representatives to apply for the FWC to deal with bargaining disputes.

    * Division 9 provides for the making of lowpaid authorisations in relation to proposed multienterprise agreements. The effect of such an authorisation is that specified employers are subject to certain rules that would not otherwise apply (for example, bargaining orders that would not usually be available for multienterprise agreements will be available). It also permits the FWC to assist the bargaining representatives for such agreements.

    * Division 10 deals with single interest employer authorisations. The effect of such an authorisation is that the employers specified in the authorisation are single interest employers in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement.

    * Division 11 deals with other matters relating to enterprise agreements.

##### 170  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

##### 171  Objects of this Part

    * The objects of this Part are: 

     * (a) to provide a simple, flexible and fair framework that enables collective bargaining in good faith, particularly at the enterprise level, for enterprise agreements that deliver productivity benefits; and

     * (b) to enable the FWC to facilitate good faith bargaining and the making of enterprise agreements, including through:

      * (i) making bargaining orders; and

### Part 26--Minimum wages

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 282  Guide to this Part

    * This Part provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to set and vary minimum wages for national system employees. For employees covered by modern awards, minimum wages are specified in the modern award. For award/agreement free employees, minimum wages are specified in the national minimum wage order.

    * Division 2 provides for the minimum wages objective. This requires the FWC to establish and maintain a safety net of fair minimum wages, taking into account certain social and economic factors.

    * Division 3 provides for the FWC (constituted by an Expert Panel) to conduct annual wage reviews. In an annual wage review, the FWC may set or vary minimum wages in modern awards, and must make a national minimum wage order. Minimum wages in modern awards can also be set, or varied (in limited circumstances), under Part 23 (which deals with modern awards).

    * Division 4 provides for national minimum wage orders and requires employers to comply with them. The orders set the national minimum wage, as well as special national minimum wages for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability. The orders also set the casual loading for award/agreement free employees.

    * National minimum wages and special national minimum wages apply to award/agreement free employees. However, they are also relevant to other employees as follows:

     * (a) in setting or varying modern award minimum wages, the FWC must take the national minimum wage into account (see subsection 135(2) (in Part 23) and subsection 285(3) (in this Part));

     * (b) for an employee who is not covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee's base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the relevant national minimum wage or special national minimum wage (see subsection 206(3) (in Part 24)).

    * For an employee who is covered by a modern award and to whom an enterprise agreement applies, the employee's base rate of pay under the agreement must not be less than the base rate of pay that would have been payable to the employee if the award applied (see subsection 206(1) (in Part 24)).

##### 283  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** means a national system employee, and **_employer_** means a national system employer.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

#### Division 2--Overarching provisions

     * (b) promoting social inclusion through increased workforce participation; and

     * (c) relative living standards and the needs of the low paid; and

     * (d) the principle of equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value; and

     * (a) the FWC's functions or powers under this Part; and

     * (b) the FWC's functions or powers under Part 23, so far as they relate to setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages.

        * Note: The FWC must also take into account the objects of this Act and any other applicable provisions. For example, if the FWC is setting, varying or revoking modern award minimum wages, the modern awards objective also applies (see section 134).

    * Meaning of **modern award minimum wages**

    * **	(3)	**_Modern award minimum wages _**are the rates of minimum wages in modern awards, including:

     * (a) wage rates for junior employees, employees to whom training arrangements apply and employees with a disability; and

     * (b) casual loadings; and

     * (c) piece rates.

    * Meaning of **setting** and **varying** modern award minimum wages

    * (4) **_Setting_** modern award minimum wages is the initial setting of one or more new modern award minimum wages in a modern award, either in the award as originally made or by a later variation of the award. **_Varying _**modern award minimum wages is varying the current rate of one or more modern award minimum wages.

     * (b) the reasons for those orders and determinations.

        * Note: The FWC must be constituted by an Expert Panel in annual wage reviews (see section 617).

    * Restriction on power to make an equal remuneration order

##### 303  Equal remuneration order may increase, but must not reduce, rates of remuneration

    * (1) Without limiting subsection 302(1), an equal remuneration order may provide for such increases in rates of remuneration as the FWC considers appropriate to ensure that, for employees to whom the order will apply, there will be equal remuneration for work of equal or comparable value.

    * An employer must not contravene a term of an equal remuneration order.

        * Note: This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).

##### 306  Inconsistency with modern awards, enterprise agreements and orders of the FWC

    * New employer ceases to outsource work to old employer

    * (5) There is a connection between the old employer and the new employer if:

    * then the enterprise agreement covers the employee organisation.

##### 316  Transferring employees who are high income employees

     * (a) the old employer had given a guarantee of annual earnings for a guaranteed period to a transferring employee; and

     * (b) the transferring employee was a high income employee immediately before the termination of the transferring employee's employment with the old employer; and

     * (d) an enterprise agreement does not apply to the transferring employee in relation to the transferring work at the transfer time.

    * (2) The guarantee of annual earnings has effect after the transfer time (except as provided in this section) as if it had been given to the transferring employee by the new employer.

    * (3) The new employer is not required to comply with the guarantee of annual earnings in relation to any part of the guaranteed period before the transfer time.

    * (4) The new employer is not required to comply with the guarantee of annual earnings to the extent that it requires the new employer to pay an amount of earnings to the transferring employee, in relation to the part of the guaranteed period after the transfer time, at a rate that is more than the annual rate of the guarantee of annual earnings.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) the transferring employee is entitled to nonmonetary benefits under the guarantee of annual earnings after the transfer time; and

     * (b) it is not practicable for the new employer to provide those benefits to the transferring employee;

    * then the guarantee of annual earnings is taken to be varied so that, instead of the entitlement to those benefits, the transferring employee is entitled to an amount of money that is equivalent to the agreed money value of those benefits.

    * (6) This section does not affect the rights and obligations of the old employer that arose before the transfer time in relation to the guarantee of annual earnings.

        * Note: See also Division 2 of Part 64A (TCF contract outworkers taken to be employees in certain circumstances).

##### 381  Object of this Part

    * (1) The object of this Part is:

     * (a) to establish a framework for dealing with unfair dismissal that balances:

      * (i) the needs of business (including small business); and

      * (ii) the needs of employees; and

     * (b) to establish procedures for dealing with unfair dismissal that:

    * The object of this Division is to establish a fair, simple and democratic process to allow a bargaining representative to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for a proposed enterprise agreement.

        * Note: Under Division 2, industrial action by employees for a proposed enterprise agreement (other than employee response action) is not protected industrial action unless it has been authorised in advance by a protected action ballot.

##### Subdivision B--Protected action ballot orders

##### 437  Application for a protected action ballot order

    * Who may apply for a protected action ballot order

    * (1) A bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by a proposed enterprise agreement, or 2 or more such bargaining representatives (acting jointly), may apply to the FWC for an order (a **_protected action ballot order_**) requiring a protected action ballot to be conducted to determine whether employees wish to engage in particular protected industrial action for the agreement.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the proposed enterprise agreement is:

     * (a) a greenfields agreement; or

     * (b) a multienterprise agreement.

    * Matters to be specified in application

    * (3) The application must specify:

     * (a) the group or groups of employees who are to be balloted; and

     * (b) the question or questions to be put to the employees who are to be balloted, including the nature of the proposed industrial action.

    * (4) If the applicant wishes a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission to be the protected action ballot agent for the protected action ballot, the application must specify the name of the person.

        * Note: The protected action ballot agent will be the Australian Electoral Commission unless the FWC specifies another person in the protected action ballot order as the protected action ballot agent (see subsection 443(4)).

    * (5) A group of employees specified under paragraph (3)(a) is taken to include only employees who:

     * (a) will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) are represented by a bargaining representative who is an applicant for the protected action ballot order; or

      * (ii) are bargaining representatives for themselves but are members of an employee organisation that is an applicant for the protected action ballot order.

    * Documents to accompany application

    * (6) The application must be accompanied by any documents and other information prescribed by the regulations.

##### 438  Restriction on when application may be made

    * (1) If one or more enterprise agreements cover the employees who will be covered by the proposed enterprise agreement, an application for a protected action ballot order must not be made earlier than 30 days before the nominal expiry date of the enterprise agreement, or the latest nominal expiry date of those enterprise agreements (as the case may be).

    * (2) To avoid doubt, making an application for a protected action ballot order does not constitute organising industrial action.

##### 439  Joint applications

    * Without limiting section 609, the procedural rules may provide for the following:

     * (a) how a provision of this Act that applies in relation to an applicant for a protected action ballot order is to apply in relation to joint applicants for such an order;

     * (b) the joinder, with the consent of each existing applicant, of one or more bargaining representatives to an application for a protected action ballot order;

     * (c) the withdrawal of one or more applicants from a joint application for a protected action ballot order.

    * Within 24 hours after making an application for a protected action ballot order, the applicant must give a copy of the application to the employer of the employees who are to be balloted, and:

     * (a) if the application specifies a person that the applicant wishes to be the protected action ballot agent--that person; or

     * (b) otherwise--the Australian Electoral Commission.

##### 441  Application to be determined within 2 days after it is made

    * (1) The FWC must, as far as practicable, determine an application for a protected action ballot order within 2 working days after the application is made.

##### 442  Dealing with multiple applications together

    * The FWC may deal with 2 or more applications for a protected action ballot order at the same time if: 

     * (a) the applications relate to industrial action by:

      * (i) employees of the same employer; or

      * (ii) employees at the same workplace; and

     * (b) the FWC is satisfied that dealing with the applications at the same time will not unreasonably delay the determination of any of the applications.

##### 443  When the FWC must make a protected action ballot order

    * (1) The FWC must make a protected action ballot order in relation to a proposed enterprise agreement if:

     * (a) an application has been made under section 437; and

     * (b) the FWC is satisfied that each applicant has been, and is, genuinely trying to reach an agreement with the employer of the employees who are to be balloted.

    * (4) If the FWC decides that a person other than the Australian Electoral Commission is to be the protected action ballot agent for the protected action ballot, the protected action ballot order must also specify:

     * (a) the person that the FWC decides, under subsection 444(1), is to be the protected action ballot agent; and

     * (b) the person (if any) that the FWC decides, under subsection 444(3), is to be the independent advisor for the ballot.

    * (5) If the FWC is satisfied, in relation to the proposed industrial action that is the subject of the protected action ballot, that there are exceptional circumstances justifying the period of written notice referred to in paragraph 414(2)(a) being longer than 3 working days, the protected action ballot order may specify a longer period of up to 7 working days.

        * Note: Under subsection 414(1), before a person engages in employee claim action for a proposed enterprise agreement, a bargaining representative of an employee who will be covered by the agreement must give written notice of the action to the employer of the employee.

    * (4) An employee, or the employee's bargaining representative, may apply to the FWC for an order under subsection (2) if a notice has been given under paragraph 471(1)(c) stating that the employee's payments will be reduced.

##### Subdivision B--Industrial action that is not protected industrial action

##### 474  Payments not to be made relating to certain periods of industrial action

    * (1) If an employee engaged, or engages, in industrial action that is not protected industrial action against an employer on a day, the employer must not make a payment to an employee in relation to:

     * (a) if the total duration of the industrial action on that day is at least 4 hours--the total duration of the industrial action on that day; or

        * Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).

        * Example: An employee, who is working a shift from 10 pm on Tuesday until 7 am on Wednesday, engages in industrial action that is not protected industrial action from 11 pm on Tuesday until 1 am on Wednesday. That industrial action would prevent the employer making a payment to the employee in relation to 4 hours of the shift, but would not prevent the employer from making a payment in relation to the remaining 5 hours of the shift.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (3), overtime is taken not to be a separate shift.
