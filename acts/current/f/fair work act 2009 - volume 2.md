### Part 63A--Transfer of business from a State public sector employer

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 768AA  Guide to this Part

    * This Part provides for the transfer of certain terms and conditions of employment when there is a transfer of business from a nonnational system employer that is a State public sector employer (called "the old State employer") to a national system employer (called "the new employer").

    * A transfer of business involves the transfer of employment of one or more employees of the old State employer to the new employer. Each of those employees is a "transferring employee".

    * If there is a transfer of business, then this Part provides for certain terms and conditions of employment with the old State employer to be transferred to the employment of the transferring employee with the new employer.

    * This Part achieves the transfer of those terms and conditions by creating a new instrument--a "copied State instrument"--for each transferring employee. The new instrument is a federal instrument and is enforceable under this Act.

##### 768AB  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** and **_employer_** have their ordinary meanings.

#### Division 2--Copying terms of State instruments when there is a transfer of business

##### 768AC  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out when there is a transfer of business from the old State employer to the new employer.

##### 768AD  When does a transfer of business occur?

    * When there is a transfer of business

    * (1) There is a **_transfer of business_** from a nonnational system employer that is a State public sector employer of a State (the **_old State employer_**) to a national system employer (the **_new employer_**) if the following requirements are satisfied:

     * (a) the employment of a person who is a State public sector employee of the old State employer has terminated;

     * (b) within 3 months after the termination, the person becomes employed by the new employer;

     * (c) the work (the **_transferring work_**) the person performs for the new employer is the same, or substantially the same, as the work the person performed for the old State employer;

     * (d) there is a connection between the old State employer and the new employer as described in subsection (2), (3) or (4).

    * Transfer of assets from old State employer to new employer

    * (2) There is a connection between the old State employer and the new employer if, in accordance with an arrangement between:

    * the new employer, or the associated entity of the new employer, owns or has the beneficial use of some or all of the assets (whether tangible or intangible):

     * (c) that the old State employer, or the associated entity of the old State employer, owned or had the beneficial use of; and

     * (d) that relate to, or are used in connection with, the transferring work.

    * Old State employer outsources work to new employer

    * (3) There is a connection between the old State employer and the new employer if the transferring work is performed by one or more transferring employees, as employees of the new employer, because the old State employer, or an associated entity of the old State employer_,_ has outsourced the transferring work to the new employer or an associated entity of the new employer.

    * New employer is an associated entity of old employer

    * (4) There is a connection between the old State employer and the new employer if the new employer is an associated entity of the old State employer when the transferring employee becomes employed by the new employer.

##### 768AE  Meaning of transferring employee, termination time and reemployment time

    * (1) The person referred to in paragraph 768AD(1)(a) is a **_transferring employee_** in relation to the transfer of business.

    * (2) The **_termination time_** of a transferring employee is the start of the day the employment of the employee is terminated by the old State employer.

    * (3) The **_reemployment time_** of a transferring employee is the start of the day the employee becomes employed by the new employer.

#### Division 3--Copied State instruments

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768AF  What this Division is about

    * If there is a transfer of business, then this Division provides for certain terms and conditions of a transferring employee's employment with the old State employer to be transferred to the employment with the new employer.

    * The transfer of those terms and conditions is achieved by creating a new instrument--called a "copied State instrument"--for the transferring employee. The new instrument is a federal instrument that is enforceable under this Act.

    * There are 2 types of copied State instruments--a copied State award and a copied State employment agreement.

    * A copied State award copies the terms of a State award that covered the transferring employee and the old State employer immediately before the termination of the employee's employment with the old State employer.

    * A copied State employment agreement copies the terms of a State employment agreement that covered the transferring employee and the old State employer immediately before the termination of the employee's employment with the old State employer.

##### Subdivision B--Copied State instruments

##### 768AG  Contravening a copied State instrument

    * A person must not contravene a term of a copied State instrument for a transferring employee that applies to the person.

        * Note 1: This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).

        * Note 2: For when a copied State instrument for a transferring employee applies to a person, see section 768AM.

##### 768AH  What is a copied State instrument?

    * A **_copied State instrument_** for a transferring employee is the following:

     * (a) a copied State award for the employee;

     * (b) a copied State employment agreement for the employee.

##### 768AI  What is a copied State award?

    * (1) If, immediately before the termination time of a transferring employee:

     * (a) a State award (the **_original State award_**) was in operation under the State industrial law of the State; and

     * (b) the original State award covered (however described in the original State award or a relevant law of the State) the old State employer and the transferring employee (whether or not the original State award also covered other persons);

    * then a **_copied State award_** for the transferring employee is taken to come into operation immediately after the termination time.

        * Note 1: Even though a copied State award comes into operation in relation to the transferring employee, it will not be enforceable by the employee or another person (for example, the new employer) unless and until it applies to the employee or other person. In particular, it will not apply to the employee or new employer before the employee becomes employed by the new employer. For when the copied State award applies to a person, see section 768AM.

        * Note 2: A copied State employment agreement for the transferring employee may also come into operation immediately after the termination time, see subsection 768AK(1). If it does, then the State's interaction rules that were in force immediately before the termination time apply for the purposes of working out the interaction between the copied State award and the copied State employment agreement (see item 11 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).

    * (2) The copied State award is taken to include the same terms as were in the original State award immediately before the termination time.

        * Note: The State's instrument content rules that were in force immediately before the termination time apply to the copied State award (see item 10 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).

    * (3) If the terms of the original State award were affected by an order, a decision or a determination of a State industrial body or a court of the State that was in operation immediately before the termination time, the terms of the copied State award are taken to be similarly affected by the terms of that order, decision or determination.

##### 768AJ  What is a State award?

    * (1) A **_State award_** is an instrument in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

     * (a) the instrument regulates terms and conditions of employment;

     * (b) the instrument was made under a State industrial law by a State industrial body;

     * (c) the instrument is referred to in that law as an award.

    * (2) However, the regulations may provide that an instrument of a specified kind:

     * (a) is a **_State award_**; or

     * (b) is not a **_State award_**.

##### 768AK  What is a copied State employment agreement?

    * (1) If, immediately before the termination time of a transferring employee:

     * (a) a State employment agreement (the **_original State agreement_**) was in operation under a State industrial law of the State; and

     * (b) the original State agreement covered (however described in the original State agreement or a relevant law of the State) the old State employer and the transferring employee (whether or not the original State agreement also covered other persons);

    * then a **_copied State employment agreement_** for the transferring employee is taken to come into operation immediately after the termination time.

        * Note 1: Even though a copied State employment agreement comes into operation for the transferring employee, it will not be enforceable by the employee or another person (for example, the new employer) unless and until it applies to the employee or other person. In particular, it will not apply to the employee or new employer before the employee becomes employed by the new employer. For when the copied State employment agreement applies to a person, see section 768AM.

        * Note 2: A copied State award for the transferring employee may also come into operation immediately after the termination time, see subsection 768AI(1). If it does, then the State's interaction rules that were in force immediately before the termination time apply for the purposes of working out the interaction between the copied State employment agreement and the copied State award (see item 11 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).

    * (2) The copied State employment agreement is taken to include the same terms as were in the original State agreement immediately before the termination time.

        * Note: The State's instrument content rules that were in force immediately before the termination time apply to the copied State employment agreement (see item 10 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).

    * (3) If the terms of the original State employment agreement were affected by an order, a decision or a determination of a State industrial body or a court of the State that was in operation immediately before the termination time, the terms of the copied State employment agreement are taken to be similarly affected by the terms of that order, decision or determination.

    * (4) If the original State agreement is a collective State employment agreement, the copied State employment agreement is a **_copied State collective employment agreement_**.

    * (5) If the original State agreement is an individual State employment agreement, the copied State employment agreement is a **_copied State individual employment agreement_**.

##### 768AL  What is a State employment agreement?

    * (1) A **_State employment agreement_** is:

     * (a) an agreement in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the agreement is between a nonnational system employer and one or more of the employees of the employer, or between a nonnational system employer and an association of employees registered under a State industrial law;

      * (ii) the agreement determines terms and conditions of employment of one or more employees of the employer;

      * (iii) the agreement was made under a State industrial law; or

     * (b) a determination in relation to which the following conditions are satisfied:

      * (i) the determination determines terms and conditions of employment;

      * (ii) the determination was made under a State industrial law by a State industrial body;

      * (iii) the determination was made in a situation in which parties who were negotiating for the making of an agreement of a kind described in paragraph (a) had not been able to reach an agreement;

      * (iv) the purpose of the determination was to resolve the matters that were at issue in those negotiations.

    * (2) However, the regulations may provide that an instrument of a specified kind:

     * (a) is a **_State employment agreement_**; or

     * (b) is not a **_State employment agreement_**.

    * (3) A State employment agreement is a **_State collective employment agreement_** unless:

     * (a) it is an agreement of a kind that, under the relevant State industrial law, could only be entered into by a single employee and a single employer; or

     * (b) the agreement is of a kind prescribed by the regulations.

    * (4) A State employment agreement referred to in paragraph (3)(a) or (b) is a **_State individual employment agreement_**.

##### 768AM  When does a copied State instrument apply to a person?

    * Transferring employee and organisations

    * (1) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee **_applies_** to the transferring employee or an organisation if:

     * (a) the instrument covers the employee or organisation; and

     * (c) no other provision of this Act provides, or has the effect, that the instrument does not apply to the employee or organisation; and

     * (d) immediately before the employee's termination time, the employee or organisation would have been:

      * (i) required by the law of the State to comply with terms of the original State award or original State agreement for the instrument; or

        * Note: This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of business by the new employer (see Part 28).

    * Other circumstances when instrument applies

    * (3) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee also **_applies _**to a person if an FWC order made under a provision of this Act provides, or has the effect, that the instrument applies to the person.

    * Instrument only applies in relation to transferring work

    * (4) A reference in this Act to a copied State instrument for a transferring employee applying to the employee is a reference to the instrument applying to the employee in relation to the transferring work of the employee.

##### 768AN  When does a copied State instrument cover a person?

    * Transferring employee and new employer

    * (1) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee **_covers_** the employee and the new employer in relation to the transferring work from the employee's reemployment time.

    * Employee organisation

    * (2) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee **_covers _**an employee organisation in relation to the employee if:

     * (a) the instrument covers the employee because of subsection (1); and

     * (b) immediately before the employee's termination time, the original State award or original State agreement for the instrument covered (however described in the original State award or original State agreement or in a relevant law of the State) the organisation in relation to the employee.

    * Employer organisation

    * (3) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee **_covers _**an employer organisation in relation to the new employer if:

     * (a) the instrument covers the new employer because of subsection (1); and

     * (b) immediately before the employee's termination time, the original State award or original State agreement for the instrument covered (however described in the original State award or original State agreement or in a relevant law of the State) the organisation in relation to the old State employer.

    * Other circumstances when a person is covered

    * (4) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee also **_covers_** a person if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the instrument covers the person:

     * (a) a provision of this Act or of the Registered Organisations Act;

     * (b) an FWC order made under a provision of this Act;

     * (c) an order of a court.

        * Example: The FWC may make a consolidation order specifying that the instrument covers a person specified in the order (see subsections 768BE(1) and 768BH(1)).

    * Circumstances when a person is not covered

    * (5) Despite subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4), a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not **_cover_** a person if any of the following provides, or has the effect, that the instrument does not cover the person:

     * (a) a provision of this Act;

     * (b) an FWC order made under a provision of this Act;

     * (c) an order of a court.

        * Example: If, after the transferring employee's reemployment time, an enterprise agreement starts to cover the employee, subsection 768AU(2) provides that a copied State instrument for the employee ceases to cover the employee.

    * (6) Despite subsections (1), (2), (3) and (4), a copied State instrument for a transferring employee that has ceased to operate does not **_cover_** a person.

    * Covered only in relation to transferring work

    * (7) A reference to a copied State instrument for a transferring employee covering the employee is a reference to the instrument covering the employee in relation to the transferring work of the employee.

##### 768AO  When is a copied State instrument in operation?

    * When instrument comes into operation

    * (1) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee comes into operation immediately after the employee's termination time.

    * When copied State award ceases to operate

    * (2) A copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to operate at the following time:

     * (a) unless paragraph (b) applies--the end of the period (the **_default period_**) that is 5 years or such longer period as is prescribed by the regulations, starting on the day the employee's termination time occurred;

     * (b) if the regulations allow the FWC to make an order to extend the period of operation of a copied State award for a transferring employee and, in accordance with those regulations, the FWC makes an order that the award operates for a period that is longer than the default period--the end of that period.

    * (3) The regulations may:

     * (a) prescribe circumstances in which the FWC may make an order for the purposes of paragraph (2)(b); and

     * (b) prescribe a maximum period that the order may specify; and

     * (c) otherwise make provision in relation to the making of the order.

    * When copied State agreement ceases to operate

    * (4) A copied State employment agreement for a transferring employee ceases to operate when it is terminated, which may happen before or after the nominal expiry date of the agreement.

        * Note 1: See section 768AY for how the copied State employment agreement can be terminated.

        * Note 2: If, after the transferring employee's reemployment time with the new employer, an enterprise agreement is made that covers the employee and the new employer, then the copied State employment agreement will cease to cover the employee and the new employer and will never cover them again, see section 768AU.

    * (5) The **_nominal expiry date_** of a copied State employment agreement for a transferring employee is:

     * (a) the day the original State agreement would nominally have expired under the State industrial law of the State; or

     * (b) if that day falls after the end of 4 years beginning on the day the employee's termination time occurs--the last day of that 4year period.

    * Once instrument ceases operation, can never operate again

    * (6) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee that has ceased to operate can never operate again.

#### Division 4--Interaction between copied State instruments and the NES, modern awards and enterprise agreements

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768AP  What this Division is about

    * This Division provides for how copied State instruments interact with the National Employment Standards, modern awards and enterprise agreements.

##### Subdivision B--Interaction with the NES

##### 768AQ  Interaction between the NES and a copied State instrument

    * To the extent that a term of a copied State instrument for a transferring employee is detrimental to the employee, in any respect, when compared to an entitlement of the employee under the National Employment Standards, the term of the instrument is of no effect.

##### 768AR  Provisions of the NES that allow instruments to contain particular kinds of terms

    * Application of particular provisions of the NES

    * (1) The following provisions have effect, on and after the reemployment time of a transferring employee, as if a reference to a modern award or an enterprise agreement included a reference to a copied State instrument for the transferring employee:

     * (a) section 63 (which allows terms dealing with averaging of hours of work);

     * (b) section 93 (which allows terms dealing with cashing out and taking paid annual leave);

     * (c) section 101 (which allows terms dealing with cashing out paid personal/carer's leave);

     * (d) subsection 107(5) (which allows terms dealing with evidence requirements for paid personal/carer's leave etc.);

     * (e) subsection 115(3) (which allows terms dealing with substitution of public holidays);

     * (f) section 118 (which allows terms dealing with an employee giving notice to terminate his or her employment);

     * (g) subsections 121(2) and (3) (which allow terms specifying situations in which the redundancy pay entitlement under section 119 does not apply);

     * (h) section 126 (which allows terms providing for schoolbased apprentices and trainees to be paid loadings in lieu).

    * Terms about paid annual leave and personal/carer's leave

    * (2) If a copied State instrument for a transferring employee:

     * (a) includes terms referred to in subsection 93(1) but the terms do not include the requirements referred to in subsection 93(2); or

     * (b) includes terms referred to in subsection 101(1) but the terms do not include the requirements referred to in subsection 101(2);

    * then the instrument is taken to include terms that include the requirements.

    * Shiftworker annual leave entitlement

    * (3) If a copied State instrument for a transferring employee applies to the employee, then subsections 87(3) to (5) have effect, on and after the employee's reemployment time, in the same way as they apply to an award/agreement free employee.

        * Note: If the transferring employee qualifies for the shiftworker annual leave entitlement under those subsections, the employee will be entitled to 5 (rather than 4) weeks of paid annual leave.

##### Subdivision C--Interaction with modern awards

##### 768AS  Modern awards and copied State awards

    * (1) While a copied State award for a transferring employee:

     * (a) covers the employee, or an employer (whether the new employer or another national system employer) or other person in relation to the employee; and

     * (b) is in operation;

    * a modern award does not cover the employee, or the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

        * Note 1: When the copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to cover the employee, a modern award will start to cover the employee, or an employer or other person in relation to the employee.

        * Note 2: This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of business by the new employer (see Part 28).

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not apply for the purposes of section 193 (which is about the better off overall test for enterprise agreements).

        * Note: For the purposes of determining whether an enterprise agreement that covers a transferring employee passes the better off overall test, subsection (2) allows the enterprise agreement to be compared against a modern award that covers the employee.

    * (3) This section has effect subject to any FWC order about coverage under subsection 768BA(1).

##### 768AT  Modern awards and copied State employment agreements

    * Copied State collective employment agreements

    * (1) If a copied State collective employment agreement for a transferring employee and a modern award both apply:

     * (a) to the employee; or

     * (b) to an employer (whether the new employer or another national system employer) or another person in relation to the employee;

    * then the copied State collective employment agreement for the employee prevails over the modern award, to the extent of any inconsistency.

        * Note 1: This subsection has effect subject to item 17 of Schedule 9 to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY. That item, as modified, requires that the base rate of pay under the copied State employment agreement must not be less than the modern award rate.

        * Note 2: This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of business by the new employer (see Part 28).

    * Copied State individual employment agreements

    * (2) While a copied State individual employment agreement for a transferring employee applies:

     * (a) to the employee; or

     * (b) to an employer (whether the new employer or another national system employer) or another person in relation to the employee;

    * a modern award does not apply to the employee, or to the employer or other person in relation to the employee.

        * Note 1: However, a modern award can cover the transferring employee while the copied State individual employment agreement applies.

        * Note 2: This subsection has effect subject to item 17 of Schedule 9 to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY. That item, as modified, requires that the base rate of pay under the copied State employment agreement must not be less than the modern award rate.

        * Note 3: This subsection may operate in relation to an employer that is not the new employer in the situation where there has been a later transfer of business by the new employer (see Part 28).

    * FWC coverage orders

    * (3) This section has effect subject to any FWC order about coverage under subsection 768BA(1).

##### Subdivision D--Interaction with enterprise agreements

##### 768AU  Enterprise agreements and copied State instruments

    * (1) While a copied State instrument for a transferring employee covers the employee and the new employer in relation to the transferring work, an enterprise agreement that covers the new employer at the employee's reemployment time does not cover the employee in relation to that work.

        * Note 1: The fact that a copied State collective employment agreement for a transferring employee covers the employee does not prevent the employee and the new employer from replacing that agreement at any time with an enterprise agreement, regardless of whether the employee's copied State collective employment agreement has passed its nominal expiry date.

        * Note 2: Industrial action must not be taken before the nominal expiry date of a copied State collective employment agreement for a transferring employee (see item 4 of Schedule 13 to the Transitional Act as that item applies in a modified way because of section 768BY).

    * (2) However, if after the reemployment time, another enterprise agreement starts to cover the employee and the new employer in relation to the transferring work, then the copied State instrument for the employee ceases to cover the employee and the new employer and can never cover them again.

    * (3) This section has effect subject to any FWC order about coverage under subsection 768BA(1).

#### Division 5--Variation and termination of copied State instruments

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768AV  What this Division is about

    * This Division sets out when a copied State instrument may be varied or terminated.

##### Subdivision B--Variation of copied State instruments

##### 768AW  Variation in limited circumstances

    * A copied State instrument for a transferring employee cannot be varied except under: 

     * (a) section 768AX; or

     * (b) item 20 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act (which deals with variation of discriminatory instruments) as that item has effect because of section 768BY; or

     * (c) item 20 of Schedule 9 to the Transitional Act (which deals with variation of instruments in annual wage reviews) as that item has effect because of section 768BY; or

     * (d) Division 4 of Part 3 of Schedule 11 to the Transitional Act (which deals with transfer of business) as that Division has effect because of section 768BY.

##### 768AX  Variation of copied State instruments

    * Application of this section

    * (1A) This section applies if there is, or is likely to be, a transfer of business.

    * Variations that may be made

    * (1) The FWC may vary a copied State instrument for a transferring employee:

     * (a) to remove terms that the FWC is satisfied are not, or will not be, capable of meaningful operation or to vary those terms so that they are capable of meaningful operation; or

     * (b) to remove an ambiguity or uncertainty in the instrument; or

     * (c) to enable the instrument to operate in a way that is better aligned to the working arrangements of the new employer's enterprise; or

     * (d) to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the interaction between the instrument and the National Employment Standards, or to make the instrument operate effectively with the National Employment Standards; or

     * (e) if the instrument is a copied State employment agreement--to resolve an uncertainty or difficulty relating to the interaction between the instrument and a modern award; or

     * (f) to remove terms that are inconsistent with Part 31 (which deals with general protections), or to vary terms to make them consistent with that Part.

        * Note: Paragraph (d) does not affect a term of the copied State instrument that is permitted by a provision of the National Employment Standards as the provision has effect under section 768AR.

    * Who may apply for a variation

    * (2) The FWC may make a variation under subsection (1):

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) on application by a person who is, or is likely to be, covered by the copied State instrument; or

     * (c) on application by an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee who is, or is likely to be, covered by the copied State instrument.

        * Note: The copied State instrument for the transferring employee may also cover another transferring employee or a nontransferring employee if a consolidation order is made.

    * Matters that the FWC must take into account

    * (3) In deciding whether to make a variation under subsection (1), the FWC must take into account the following:

     * (a) the views of:

      * (i) the employees who would be affected by the copied State instrument as varied; and

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

     * (b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the copied State instrument as varied in relation to their terms and conditions of employment;

     * (c) if the copied State instrument is a copied State employment agreement--the nominal expiry date of the agreement;

     * (d) whether the copied State instrument, without the variation, would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new employer's workplace;

     * (e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic disadvantage as a result of the copied State instrument, without the variation;

     * (f) the degree of business synergy between the copied State instrument, without the variation, and any workplace instrument that already covers the new employer;

     * (g) the public interest.

    * Variation relating to the NES

    * (4) If there is a dispute about the making of a variation for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), the FWC may compare the entitlements that are in dispute:

     * (a) on a "linebyline" basis, comparing individual terms; or

     * (b) on a "likebylike" basis, comparing entitlements according to particular subject areas; or

     * (c) using any combination of the above approaches the FWC sees fit.

    * (5) The regulations may make provisions that apply to determining, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), whether terms of a copied State instrument for a transferring employee are, or are not, detrimental in any respect when compared to entitlements under the National Employment Standards.

    * When variation may be made

    * (6) A variation may be made under subsection (1) in relation to a copied State instrument of a transferring employee:

     * (a) before the copied State instrument comes into operation, if it is likely that the instrument will come into operation; and

     * (b) before the employee is a transferring employee, if it is likely that the employee will become a transferring employee.

    * Restriction on when variation may come into operation

    * (7) A variation under subsection (1) operates from the day specified in the variation, which may be a day before the variation is made.

##### Subdivision C--Termination of copied State instruments

##### 768AY  Termination in limited circumstances

    * (1) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee cannot be terminated except under items 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26 of Schedule 3A to the Transitional Act (which deal with termination of State employment agreements) as those items have effect because of section 768BY.

    * (2) A copied State instrument for a transferring employee that has been terminated ceases to operate and can never operate again.

        * Note: A copied State instrument that does not operate cannot cover a person (see subsection 768AN(6)).

#### Division 6--FWC orders about coverage of copied State instruments and other instruments

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768AZ  What this Division is about

    * This Division allows the FWC to make an order that a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not, or will not, cover the employee and that an enterprise agreement or named employer award that covers the new employer covers, or will cover, the employee instead.

    * It also allows the FWC to make an order that a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not, or will not, cover an employee organisation but instead covers, or will cover, another employee organisation.

##### 768AZA  Orders in relation to a transfer of business

    * (1) This Division provides for orders to be made if there is, or is likely to be, a transfer of business.

    * (2) An order may be made under this Division in relation to a copied State instrument of a transferring employee:

     * (a) before the copied State instrument comes into operation, if it is likely that the instrument will come into operation; and

     * (b) before the employee is a transferring employee, if it is likely that the employee will become a transferring employee.

##### Subdivision B--Coverage orders

##### 768BA  FWC orders about coverage for transferring employees

    * Orders that the FWC may make

    * (1) The FWC may make the following orders:

     * (a) an order that a copied State instrument for a transferring employee that would, or would be likely to, cover the transferring employee and the new employer because of subsection 768AN(1) does not, or will not, cover the transferring employee and the new employer;

     * (b) an order that an enterprise agreement or named employer award that covers the new employer at the transferring employee's reemployment time covers, or will cover, the transferring employee.

    * Who may apply for an order

    * (2) The FWC may make an order under subsection (1):

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) on application by any of the following:

      * (i) a transferring employee or an employee who is likely to be a transferring employee;

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

      * (iii) an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee referred to in subparagraph (i);

      * (iv) if the application relates to an enterprise agreement--an employee organisation that is, or is likely to be, covered by the agreement.

    * Matters that the FWC must take into account

    * (3) In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (1), the FWC must take into account the following:

     * (a) the views of:

      * (i) the employees who would be affected by the order; and

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

     * (b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the order in relation to their terms and conditions of employment;

     * (c) if the order relates to a copied State employment agreement or an enterprise agreement--the nominal expiry date of the agreement;

     * (d) whether the copied State instrument would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new employer's workplace;

     * (e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic disadvantage as a result of the copied State instrument covering the new employer;

     * (f) the degree of business synergy between the copied State instrument and any workplace instrument that already covers the new employer;

     * (g) the public interest.

    * Restriction on when order may come into operation

    * (4) An order under subsection (1) must not come into operation in relation to a particular transferring employee before the later of the following:

     * (a) the transferring employee's reemployment time;

     * (b) the day on which the order is made.

##### 768BB  FWC orders about coverage for employee organisations

    * (1) The FWC may make an order that:

     * (a) a copied State instrument for a transferring employee that would, or would be likely to, cover an employee organisation (the **_first employee organisation_**) in relation to the transferring employee because of subsection 768AN(2) does not, or will not, cover the organisation; and

     * (b) another employee organisation (the **_second employee organisation_**) is, or will be, covered by the copied State instrument in relation to the employee.

    * (2) When making an order under subsection (1), the FWC must consider whether the second employee organisation is a federal counterpart (within the meaning of section 9A of the Registered Organisations Act) of the first employee organisation.

    * (3) The regulations may:

     * (a) prescribe circumstances in which the FWC may make an order for the purposes of subsection (1); and

     * (b) otherwise make provision in relation to the making of the order.

    * (4) An order under subsection (1) must be made in accordance with any regulations that are made for the purposes of subsection (3).

#### Division 7--FWC orders about consolidating copied State instruments etc.

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768BC  What this Division is about

    * This Division allows the FWC to consolidate the various workplace instruments that may apply in the new employer's workplace. It achieves this by allowing the FWC to make an order that a copied State instrument for a particular transferring employee is also a copied State instrument for one or more other transferring employees or nontransferring employees.

    * Subdivision B deals with consolidating copied State instruments for transferring employees. Under that Subdivision, the FWC may make an order that the copied State instrument for a transferring employee ("employee A") is also the copied State instrument for one or more other transferring employees. If the FWC makes a consolidation order for those other transferring employees, then this Act is modified so that the copied State instrument for employee A is also the copied State instrument for those other transferring employees (see section 768BF).

    * Subdivision C deals with nontransferring employees. Under that Subdivision, the FWC may make an order that the copied State instrument for employee A (who is a transferring employee) is also the copied State instrument for one or more nontransferring employees. If the FWC makes a consolidation order for those nontransferring employees, then this Act is modified so that the copied State instrument for employee A is also the copied State instrument for those nontransferring employees (see section 768BI).

##### 768BCA  Orders in relation to a transfer of business

    * (1) This Division provides for orders to be made if there is, or is likely to be, a transfer of business.

    * (2) An order may be made under this Division in relation to a copied State instrument of a transferring employee:

     * (a) before the copied State instrument comes into operation, if it is likely that the instrument will come into operation; and

     * (b) before the employee is a transferring employee, if it is likely that the employee will become a transferring employee.

##### Subdivision B--Consolidation orders in relation to transferring employees

##### 768BD  Consolidation orders in relation to transferring employees

    * Consolidation order

    * (1) The FWC may make an order (a **_consolidation order_**) that a copied State instrument for a transferring employee (**_employee A_**) is also a copied State instrument for one or more other transferring employees.

    * Who may apply for order

    * (2) The FWC may make a consolidation order under subsection (1):

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) on application by any of the following:

      * (i) a transferring employee, or an employee who is likely to be a transferring employee;

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

      * (iii) an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee referred to in subparagraph (i).

    * Matters that the FWC must take into account

    * (3) In deciding whether to make a consolidation order under subsection (1), the FWC must take into account the following:

     * (a) the views of:

      * (i) the employees who would be affected by the order; and

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

     * (b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the order in relation to their terms and conditions of employment;

     * (c) if the order relates to a copied State employment agreement--the nominal expiry date of the agreement;

     * (d) whether the copied State instrument for employee A would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new employer's workplace;

     * (e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic disadvantage if the order were not made;

     * (f) the degree of business synergy between the copied State instrument for employee A and any workplace instrument that already covers the new employer;

     * (g) the public interest.

    * Restriction on when order may come into operation

    * (4) A consolidation order under subsection (1) must not come into operation in relation to a particular transferring employee (other than employee A) before the later of the following:

     * (a) the transferring employee's reemployment time;

     * (b) the day on which the order is made.

##### 768BE  Consolidation order to deal with application and coverage

    * (1) A consolidation order under subsection 768BD(1) must specify when the copied State instrument for employee A applies to, and covers:

     * (a) another transferring employee; and

     * (b) the new employer in relation to the other transferring employee; and

     * (c) an employee organisation in relation to the other transferring employee;

    * which must not be before the other transferring employee's reemployment time.

    * (2) Once the consolidation order comes into operation in relation to the other transferring employee, the copied State instrument for the other transferring employee ceases to operate.

##### 768BF  Effect of this Act after a consolidation order is made

    * If the FWC makes a consolidation order under subsection 768BD(1), then this Act has effect in relation to a particular transferring employee (other than employee A), from the time the order comes into operation in relation to that employee, as if a reference in relation to that employee to the copied State instrument for that employee were a reference to the copied State instrument for employee A.

##### Subdivision C--Consolidation orders in relation to nontransferring employees

##### 768BG  Consolidation orders in relation to nontransferring employees

    * Consolidation order

    * (1) The FWC may make an order (a **_consolidation order_**) that a copied State instrument for a transferring employee (**_employee A_**) also is, or will be, a copied State instrument for one or more nontransferring employees who perform, or are likely to perform, the transferring work.

    * Nontransferring employees

    * (2) A **_nontransferring employee_** of a new employer is a national system employee of the new employer who is not a transferring employee.

    * Who may apply for order

    * (3) The FWC may make a consolidation order under subsection (1):

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) on application by any of the following:

      * (i) a nontransferring employee who performs, or is likely to perform, the transferring work;

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

      * (iii) an employee organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of an employee referred to in subparagraph (i);

      * (iv) if the application relates to an enterprise agreement--an employee organisation that is, or is likely to be, covered by the agreement.

    * Matters that the FWC must take into account

    * (4) In deciding whether to make a consolidation order under subsection (1), the FWC must take into account the following:

     * (a) the views of:

      * (i) the employees who would be affected by the order; and

      * (ii) the new employer or a person who is likely to be the new employer;

     * (b) whether any employees would be disadvantaged by the order in relation to their terms and conditions of employment;

     * (c) if the order relates to a copied State employment agreement or an enterprise agreement--the nominal expiry date of the agreement;

     * (d) whether the copied State instrument for employee A would have a negative impact on the productivity of the new employer's workplace;

     * (e) whether the new employer would incur significant economic disadvantage if the order were not made;

     * (f) the degree of business synergy between the copied State instrument for employee A and any workplace instrument that already covers the new employer;

     * (g) the public interest.

    * Restriction on when order may come into operation

    * (5) A consolidation order under subsection (1) must not come into operation in relation to a particular nontransferring employee before the later of the following:

     * (a) the time when the nontransferring employee starts to perform the transferring work for the new employer;

     * (b) the day on which the order is made.

##### 768BH  Consolidation order to deal with application and coverage

    * (1) A consolidation order under subsection 768BG(1) must specify when the copied State instrument for employee A applies to, and covers:

     * (a) a nontransferring employee; and

     * (b) the new employer in relation to the nontransferring employee; and

     * (c) an employee organisation in relation to the nontransferring employee;

    * in relation to the transferring work.

    * (2) If an enterprise agreement covers the nontransferring employee and the new employer, the order must also specify that the agreement does not cover:

     * (a) the nontransferring employee; or

     * (b) the new employer in relation to the nontransferring employee; or

     * (c) an employee organisation in relation to the nontransferring employee;

    * in relation to that work.

##### 768BI  Effect of this Act after a consolidation order is made

    * If the FWC makes a consolidation order under subsection 768BG(1), then this Act has effect in relation to a particular nontransferring employee, from the time the order comes into operation in relation to that employee, as if:

     * (a) the copied State instrument for employee A were also the copied State instrument for that employee; and

     * (b) that employee were a transferring employee in relation to that copied State instrument.

#### Division 8--Special rules for copied State instruments

##### Subdivision A--Guide to this Division

##### 768BJ  What this Division is about

    * This Division has a collection of special rules for copied State instruments for transferring employees.

    * Subdivision B deals with the case where a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not have a term about settling disputes about matters arising under the instrument. In that case, the model term prescribed by the regulations is taken to be a term of the instrument.

    * Subdivision C is about working out service and entitlements of a transferring employee. This is particularly relevant for working out the employee's entitlements under the National Employment Standards and the copied State instrument for the employee.

    * Subdivision D deals with the case where a copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to operate and the employee suffers a reduction in take home pay. That Subdivision allows the FWC to make a takehome pay order to compensate the employee.

    * Subdivision E modifies particular provisions of this Act in relation to copied State instruments.

    * Subdivision F modifies particular provisions of the Transitional Act in relation to copied State instruments.

    * Subdivision G modifies particular provisions of the Registered Organisations Act in relation to copied State instruments.

##### Subdivision B--Terms about disputes

##### 768BK  Where no term dealing with disputes

    * (1) If a copied State instrument for a transferring employee does not include a term that provides a procedure for settling disputes about matters arising under the instrument, then the instrument is taken to include the model term that is prescribed by the regulations for settling disputes about matters arising under a copied State instrument for a transferring employee.

        * Note: This section deals with the situation where the original State award or original State agreement for the copied State instrument did not include a term about settling disputes about matters arising under the award or agreement.

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the model term prescribed for a copied State award for a transferring employee may be the same or different from the model term prescribed for a copied State employment agreement for a transferring employee.

##### Subdivision C--Service and entitlements of a transferring employee

##### 768BL  Service for the purposes of this Act

    * General rule

    * (1) Service of a transferring employee with the old State employer that occurred before the employee's termination time also counts as service of the employee with the new employer for the purposes of this Act (including for the purposes of determining the employee's entitlements under the National Employment Standards) after the employee's reemployment time.

    * Gap between termination time and reemployment time

    * (2) If there is a period of time between the employee's termination time with the old State employer and the employee's reemployment time with the new employer, then that period:

     * (a) does not break the employee's continuous service with the new employer (taking account of the effect of subsection (1)); but

     * (b) does not count towards the length of the employee's continuous service with the new employer.

##### 768BM  NES--working out nonaccruing entitlements

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the entitlements of a transferring employee under the National Employment Standards, other than entitlements to:

     * (a) paid annual leave; or

     * (b) paid personal/carer's leave.

        * Note: For entitlements to paid annual leave and paid personal/carer's leave under the National Employment Standards, see section 768BN.

    * No double entitlement

    * (2) If, before or after the employee's termination time, the employee has the benefit of an entitlement, the amount of which is calculated by reference to a period of service, then subsection 768BL(1) does not result in that period of service with the old State employer being counted again when calculating the employee's entitlements of that kind under the National Employment Standards.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not require the employee to serve any initial qualifying period of service for long service leave again.

    * Limitation on application of general rule to redundancy pay

    * (4) If the terms and conditions of employment that applied to the employee's employment by the old State employer immediately before the employee's termination time did not provide for an entitlement to redundancy pay, then subsection 768BL(1) does not apply in relation to the employee and the new employer for the purposes of Subdivision B of Division 11 of Part 22 (which deals with redundancy pay).

    * (5) If a State industrial body could have made an order giving the employee an entitlement to redundancy pay (however described), had the employee's employment been terminated for redundancy (however described) before the employee's termination time, then:

     * (a) the terms and conditions of the employee's employment referred to in subsection (4) are taken to have provided for an entitlement to redundancy pay; and

     * (b) paragraph 121(1)(b) does not apply in relation to the employee during the 12 months starting at the employee's reemployment time.

        * Note: Because of paragraph (b), the employee may therefore be entitled to redundancy pay under section 119 if the employee's employment is terminated by the new employer during the 12month period starting at the employee's termination time, even if the new employer is a small business employer.

##### 768BN  NES--working out accruing entitlements

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the entitlements of a transferring employee under the National Employment Standards to:

     * (a) paid annual leave; or

     * (b) paid personal/carer's leave;

    * if the employee had, immediately before the employee's termination time, an accrued entitlement to an amount of:

     * (c) paid annual leave (however described); or

     * (d) paid personal or carer's leave (however described).

        * Note: For other entitlements under the National Employment Standards, see section 768BM.

    * Leave accrued for purposes of the NES

    * (2) The provisions of the National Employment Standards relating to:

     * (a) taking that kind of leave (including rates of pay while taking leave); or

     * (b) cashingout that kind of leave;

    * apply as a minimum standard to the accrued leave, after the employee's reemployment time, as if it had accrued under the National Employment Standards.

    * No double entitlement

    * (3) However, if before or after the employee's termination time, the old State employer paid the employee an amount in relation to some or all of the accrued leave, then for the purposes of subsection (2), the amount of accrued leave is reduced accordingly.

    * Working out whether leave accrued

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), it does not matter whether the entitlement to leave accrued under:

     * (a) the original State award or original State agreement for the copied State instrument for the employee; or

     * (b) a State industrial law of the State.

##### 768BO  Copied State instrument--service

    * General rule

    * (1) Service of a transferring employee with the old State employer that:

     * (a) occurred before the employee's termination time; and

     * (b) counted for the purposes of the application to the employee of the original State award or original State agreement for the copied State instrument for the employee;

    * also counts as service of the employee with the new employer for the purposes of the application to the employee of the copied State instrument after the employee's reemployment time.

    * Gap between termination time and reemployment time

    * (2) If there is a period of time between the employee's termination time with the old State employer and the employee's reemployment time with the new employer, then that period:

     * (a) does not break the employee's continuous service with the new employer (taking account of the effect of subsection (1)); but

     * (b) does not count towards the length of the employee's continuous service with the new employer.

    * Effect of consolidation order

    * (3) If the FWC makes a consolidation order under subsection 768BD(1), then, despite section 768BF, the original State award or original State agreement referred to in paragraph (1)(b) of this section is the original State award or original State agreement for the copied State instrument for the employee before the consolidation order was made.

##### 768BP  Copied State instrument--working out nonaccruing entitlements

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the entitlements of a transferring employee under a copied State instrument for the employee, other than entitlements to:

     * (a) annual leave (however described); or

     * (b) personal leave or carer's leave (however described).

        * Note: For entitlements to annual leave or personal leave or carer's leave under the copied State instrument, see section 768BQ.

    * No double entitlement

    * (2) If, before or after the employee's termination time, the employee has the benefit of an entitlement, the amount of which is calculated by reference to a period of service, then subsection 768BO(1) does not result in that period of service with the old State employer being counted again when calculating the employee's entitlements of that kind under the copied State instrument for the employee.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, subsection (2) does not require the employee to serve any initial qualifying period of service for long service leave again.

##### 768BQ  Copied State instrument--working out accruing entitlements

    * Application of this section

    * (1) This section applies for the purposes of determining the entitlements of a transferring employee under the copied State instrument for the employee to:

     * (a) annual leave (however described); or

     * (b) personal leave or carer's leave (however described).

        * Note: For other entitlements under the copied State instrument, see section 768BP.

    * Leave accrued for purposes of the instrument

    * (2) If the employee had, immediately before the employee's termination time, an accrued entitlement to an amount of:

     * (a) annual leave (however described); or

     * (b) personal leave or carer's leave (however described);

    * then the accrued leave is taken to have accrued under the copied State instrument for the employee.

    * No double entitlement

    * (3) However, if before or after the employee's termination time, the old State employer paid the employee an amount in relation to some or all of the accrued leave, then for the purposes of subsection (2), the amount of accrued leave is reduced accordingly.

    * Working out whether leave accrued

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (2), it does not matter whether the leave accrued under:

     * (a) the original State award or original State agreement for the copied State instrument; or

     * (b) a State industrial law of the State.

##### Subdivision D--Cessation of copied State awards: avoiding reductions in takehome pay

##### 768BR  Cessation not intended to result in reduction in takehome pay

    * (1) If a copied State award for a transferring employee ceases to operate because of subsection 768AO(2), the cessation is not intended to result in a reduction in the takehome pay of the employee.

    * (2) A transferring employee's **_takehome pay_** is the pay the employee actually receives:

     * (a) including wages and incentivebased payments, and additional amounts such as allowances and overtime; but

     * (b) disregarding the effect of any deductions that are made as permitted by section 324.

        * Note: Deductions permitted by section 324 may (for example) include deductions under salary sacrificing arrangements.

    * (3) A transferring employee suffers a **_reduction in takehome pay_** if, and only if:

     * (a) when the copied State award for the employee ceases to operate because of subsection 768AO(2), the employee becomes a person to whom a modern award applies; and

     * (b) the employee is employed in the same position as (or a position that is comparable to) the position he or she was employed in immediately before the cessation of the copied State award; and

     * (c) the amount of the employee's takehome pay for working particular hours or for a particular quantity of work after the cessation of the copied State award is less than what would have been the employee's takehome pay for those hours or that quantity of work immediately before the cessation; and

     * (d) that reduction in the employee's takehome pay is attributable to the cessation of the copied State award.

##### 768BS  Orders remedying reductions in takehome pay

    * (1) If the FWC is satisfied that a transferring employee to whom a modern award applies has suffered a reduction in takehome pay, the FWC may make any order (a **_takehome pay order_**) requiring, or relating to, the payment of an amount or amounts to the employee that the FWC considers appropriate to remedy the situation.

    * (2) The FWC may make a takehome pay order:

     * (a) on its own initiative; or

     * (b) on application by either of the following:

      * (i) a transferring employee who has suffered a reduction in takehome pay;

      * (ii) an organisation that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the employee.

    * (3) The FWC must not make a takehome pay order if:

     * (a) the FWC considers that the reduction in takehome pay is minor or insignificant; or

     * (b) the FWC is satisfied that the employee has been adequately compensated in other ways for the reduction.

    * (4) The FWC must ensure that a takehome pay order is expressed so that:

     * (a) it does not apply to a transferring employee unless the employee has actually suffered a reduction in takehome pay; and

     * (b) if the takehome pay payable to the employee under the modern award increases after the order is made, there is a corresponding reduction in any amount payable to the employee under the order.

    * (5) If the FWC is satisfied that an application for a takehome pay order has already been made in relation to a transferring employee, the FWC may dismiss any later application that is made under these provisions in relation to the same employee.

##### 768BT  Contravening a takehome pay order

    * A person must not contravene a term of a takehome pay order that applies to the person.

        * Note: This section is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).

##### 768BU  How long a takehome pay order continues to apply

    * A takehome pay order made in relation to a transferring employee to whom a particular modern award applies continues to apply in relation to the employee (subject to the terms of the order) for so long as the modern award continues to cover the employee.

        * Note: It does not matter if the modern award stops applying to the employee because an enterprise agreement starts to apply.

##### 768BV  Interaction of takehome pay orders with modern awards and enterprise agreements

    * A term of a modern award or an enterprise agreement has no effect in relation to a transferring employee to the extent that it is less beneficial to the employee than a term of a takehome pay order that applies to the employee.

##### 768BW  Application of this Act to takehome pay orders

    * This Act applies as if the following provisions included a reference to a takehome pay order: 

     * (a) subsection 675(2) (which is about FWC orders);

     * (b) subsection 706(2) (which is about powers of inspectors).

##### Subdivision E--Modification of this Act

##### 768BX  Modification of this Act for copied State instruments

    * This Act has effect in relation to a transferring employee on and after the employee's reemployment time as if a reference in a provision referred to in column 1 to a term referred to in column 2 included a reference to the term referred to in column 3.

##### Subdivision F--Modification of the Transitional Act

##### 768BY  Modification of the Transitional Act for copied State instruments

    * (1) Each relevant transitional provision (see subsection (2)) has effect in relation to a transferring employee as if a reference to a term referred to in column 1 were a reference to the term referred to in column 2. The provision has effect from the time specified in column 3 of the table in subsection (2).

    * (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the **_relevant transitional provisions_** are:

     * (a) the provisions of the Transitional Act that are listed in column 1; and

     * (b) the regulations made for the purposes of those provisions.

##### Subdivision G--Modification of the Registered Organisations Act

##### 768BZ  Modification of the Registered Organisations Act for copied State instruments

    * (1) The Registered Organisations Act has effect in relation to a transferring employee on and after the employee's termination time as if:

     * (a) a reference in that Act to a modern award included a reference to a copied State award for the employee; and

     * (b) a reference in that Act to an enterprise agreement included a reference to a copied State employment agreement for the employee.

    * (2) The regulations may deal with other matters relating to how the Registered Organisations Act applies in relation to a transferring employee.

#### Division 9--Regulations

##### 768CA  Regulations

    * (1) The regulations may:

     * (a) make provision in relation to the transition from State awards and State employment agreements to copied State instruments; and

     * (b) make provision in relation to the transition from copied State instruments to modern awards and enterprise agreements; and

     * (c) deal with how this Act applies in relation to copied State instruments for transferring employees; and

     * (d) provide that provisions of this Act or the Transitional Act apply in relation to transferring employees or new employers with specified modifications; and

     * (e) otherwise make provision relating to how provisions of this Act or the Transitional Act apply in relation to transferring employees or new employers; and

     * (f) make provision in relation to nontransferring employees of the new employer; and

     * (g) provide that provisions of this Act or the Transitional Act apply in relation to the nontransferring employees with specified modifications; and

     * (h) make other provision in relation to the matters dealt with in this Part.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the regulations may:

     * (a) modify provisions of this Act or the Transitional Act, or provide for the application (with or without modifications) of provisions of this Act or the Transitional Act to matters to which they would otherwise not apply; and

     * (b) provide differently for the purposes of different provisions, or in relation to different situations.

    * (3) However, this section does not allow regulations to:

     * (a) modify a provision so as to impose an obligation which, if contravened, constitutes an offence; or

     * (b) include new provisions that create offences.

    * (4) The provisions of this Part (including this section) that provide for regulations to deal with matters do not limit each other.

### Part 64--Additional provisions relating to termination of employment

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 769  Guide to this Part

    * This Part contains provisions to give effect, or further effect, to certain international agreements relating to discrimination and termination of employment.

    * Division 2 makes it unlawful for an employer to terminate an employee's employment for certain reasons. Division 2 also deals with compliance. In most cases, a dispute that involves the termination of an employee's employment will be dealt with by a court only if the dispute has not been resolved by the FWC.

    * Division 3 sets out notification and consultation requirements in relation to certain terminations of employment.

##### 770  Meanings of employee and employer

    * In this Part, **_employee_** and **_employer_** have their ordinary meanings.

#### Division 2--Termination of employment

##### 771  Object of this Division

    * The object of this Division is to give effect, or further effect, to:

     * (a) the ILO Convention (No. 111) concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, done at Geneva on 25 June 1958 ([1974] ATS 12); and

     * (b) the ILO Convention (No. 156) concerning Equal Opportunities and Equal Treatment for Men and Women Workers: Workers with Family Responsibilities, done at Geneva on 23 June 1981 ([1991] ATS 7); and

     * (c) the ILO Convention (No. 158) concerning Termination of Employment at the Initiative of the Employer, done at Geneva on 22 June 1982 ([1994] ATS 4); and

     * (d) the Termination of Employment Recommendation, 1982 (Recommendation No. R166) which the General Conference of the ILO adopted on 22 June 1982.

        * Note 1: In 2009, the text of a Convention in the Australian Treaty Series was accessible through the Australian Treaties Library on the AustLII website (www.austlii.edu.au).

        * Note 2: In 2009, the text of a Recommendation adopted by the General Conference of the ILO was accessible through the ILO website (www.ilo.org).

##### 772  Employment not to be terminated on certain grounds

    * (1) An employer must not terminate an employee's employment for one or more of the following reasons, or for reasons including one or more of the following reasons:

     * (a) temporary absence from work because of illness or injury of a kind prescribed by the regulations;

     * (b) trade union membership or participation in trade union activities outside working hours or, with the employer's consent, during working hours;

     * (c) nonmembership of a trade union;

     * (d) seeking office as, or acting or having acted in the capacity of, a representative of employees;

     * (e) the filing of a complaint, or the participation in proceedings, against an employer involving alleged violation of laws or regulations or recourse to competent administrative authorities;

     * (f) race, colour, sex, sexual orientation, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, family or carer's responsibilities, pregnancy, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin;

     * (g) absence from work during maternity leave or other parental leave;

     * (h) temporary absence from work for the purpose of engaging in a voluntary emergency management activity, where the absence is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.

        * Note: This subsection is a civil remedy provision (see Part 41).

    * (2) However, subsection (1) does not prevent a matter referred to in paragraph (1)(f) from being a reason for terminating a person's employment if:

     * (a) the reason is based on the inherent requirements of the particular position concerned; or

     * (b) if the person is a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed--the employment is terminated:

      * (i) in good faith; and

      * (ii) to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, if:

     * (a) an employer terminates an employee's employment; and

     * (b) the reason, or a reason, for the termination is that the position held by the employee no longer exists, or will no longer exist; and

     * (c) the reason, or a reason, that the position held by the employee no longer exists, or will no longer exist, is the employee's absence, or proposed or probable absence, during maternity leave or other parental leave;

    * the employee's employment is taken, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(g), to have been terminated for the reason, or for reasons including the reason, of absence from work during maternity leave or other parental leave.

    * (4) For the purposes of subsection (1), subsection 109(2) (which deals with the meaning of **_voluntary emergency management activity_**) has effect as if the word employee had its ordinary meaning.

##### 773  Application for the FWC to deal with a dispute

    * If: 

     * (a) an employer has terminated an employee's employment; and

     * (b) the employee, or an industrial association that is entitled to represent the industrial interests of the employee, alleges that the employee's employment was terminated in contravention of subsection 772(1);

    * the employee, or the industrial association, may apply to the FWC for the FWC to deal with the dispute.

##### 774  Time for application

    * (1) An application under section 773 must be made:

     * (a) within 21 days after the employment was terminated; or

     * (b) within such further period as the FWC allows under subsection (2).

    * (2) The FWC may allow a further period if the FWC is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, taking into account:

     * (a) the reason for the delay; and

     * (b) any action taken by the employee to dispute the termination; and

     * (c) prejudice to the employer (including prejudice caused by the delay); and

     * (d) the merits of the application; and

     * (e) fairness as between the person and other persons in a like position.

##### 775  Application fees

    * (1) The application must be accompanied by any fee prescribed by the regulations.

    * (2) The regulations may prescribe:

     * (a) a fee for making an application to the FWC under section 773; and

     * (b) a method for indexing the fee; and

     * (c) the circumstances in which all or part of the fee may be waived or refunded.

##### 776  Dealing with a dispute (other than by arbitration)

    * (1) If an application is made under section 773, the FWC must deal with the dispute (other than by arbitration).

        * Note: The FWC may deal with a dispute by mediation or conciliation, or by making a recommendation or expressing an opinion (see subsection 595(2)).

    * (2) Any conference conducted for the purposes of dealing with the dispute (other than by arbitration) must be conducted in private, despite subsection 592(3).

        * Note: For conferences, see section 592.

    * (3) If the FWC is satisfied that all reasonable attempts to resolve the dispute (other than by arbitration) have been, or are likely to be, unsuccessful, then:

     * (a) the FWC must issue a certificate to that effect; and

     * (b) if the FWC considers, taking into account all the materials before it, that arbitration under section 777, or an unlawful termination court application, in relation to the dispute would not have a reasonable prospect of success, the FWC must advise the parties accordingly.

    * (4) An **_unlawful termination court application_** is an application to a court under Division 2 of Part 41 for orders in relation to a contravention of subsection 772(1).

##### 777  Dealing with a dispute by arbitration

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) the FWC issues a certificate under paragraph 776(3)(a) in relation to the dispute; and

     * (b) the parties notify the FWC that they agree to the FWC arbitrating the dispute; and

     * (c) the notification:

      * (i) is given to the FWC within 14 days after the day the certificate is issued, or within such period as the FWC allows on an application made during or after those 14 days; and

      * (ii) complies with any requirements prescribed by the procedural rules; and

     * (d) sections 726, 727, 728, 729, 731 and 732 do not apply.

        * Note: Sections 726, 727, 728, 729, 731 and 732 prevent multiple applications or complaints of a kind referred to in those sections from being made in relation to the same dispute. A notification can only be made under this section where there is no such other application or complaint in relation to the dispute at the time the notification is made.

     * (b) of an unreasonable act or omission of the representative in connection with the conduct or continuation of the dispute.

    * (3) The FWC may make an order under this section only if the other party to the dispute has applied for it in accordance with section 781.

    * (2) If a schedule of costs is prescribed for the purposes of subsection (1), then, in awarding costs under section 611, 779A or 780 in relation to an application under section 773, the FWC:

##### 3  Effect on TCF contract outworker's entitlements
