### Part 2--Farm household allowance

#### Division 1--Simplified outline of this Part

##### 7  Simplified outline of this Part

    * Farm household allowance is payable to certain farmers and their partners. A person must qualify for farm household allowance for the allowance to be payable. The allowance is payable for a cumulative period of up to 3 years.

    * To qualify for the allowance as a farmer, a person must contribute significant labour and capital to a farm enterprise that has a significant commercial purpose or character. The partner of such a person may also qualify for the allowance.

    * Another requirement for a person to qualify for the allowance is that the person is willing to enter into a financial improvement agreement. A financial improvement agreement sets out the activities that the person must do for the purposes of the activity test (which is a test that a person to whom the allowance is payable is generally required to satisfy). The kinds of activities that may be set out in a financial improvement agreement include receiving training or advice from an appropriately qualified person, or undertaking study.

    * In certain circumstances, a person may be exempt from the activity test (for example, during periods that are essential to the operation of the farm or if a person is temporarily incapacitated).

    * Even if a person qualifies for farm household allowance, the allowance may not be payable (such as where the value of the person's assets exceeds a certain limit, where the person receives other support under the Social Security Act or where the person is subject to a waiting period).

    * Farm household allowance may continue to be payable during a person's period of absence from Australia. (The period is generally no longer than 6 weeks.)

    * A person's rate of farm household allowance depends on the age of the person. For a person who has not turned 22, the rate is worked out using the Youth Allowance Rate Calculator in the Social Security Act. Otherwise, the rate is worked out using the Benefit Rate Calculator B in that Act (which is also used to work out newstart allowance). Some modifications are made to the Calculators for the purposes of farm household allowance.

    * There are certain obligations imposed on a person to whom farm household allowance is payable. Farm household allowance may cease to be payable to a person who fails to comply with these obligations.

    * The rules dealing with how to make claims, how payments are made and review of decisions relating to farm household allowance are found in the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act. (This is because Part 5 of this Act applies and modifies the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act in relation to farm household allowance.)

#### Division 2--Basic qualifications of farmers and their partners for farm household allowance

##### 8  Qualification of farmers for farm household allowance

    * A person is qualified for farm household allowance for a period if throughout the period:

##### 9  Qualification of farmers' partners for farm household allowance

     * (a) the person is not qualified for farm household allowance under section 8; and

     * (b) the person is a member of a couple; and

     * (c) the person's partner is a farmer; and

     * (d) the farmer contributes a significant part of his or her labour and capital to a farm enterprise; and

     * (e) the farm enterprise has a significant commercial purpose or character; and

     * (f) the land that is used for the purposes of the farm enterprise is in Australia; and

     * (g) the farmer resides in Australia; and

     * (h) the person is an Australian resident, and is in Australia; and

     * (i) either:

      * (i) the person has indicated, in writing, that the person is willing to enter into, and comply with, a financial improvement agreement; or

      * (ii) a financial improvement agreement is in force in relation to the person; and

     * (j) the person's cumulative period of farm household allowance is 3 years or less.

        * Note 1: For paragraph (d), see section 11 if a person is exempt from the activity test under section 31 (temporary incapacity).

        * Note 2: Paragraph (h) is subject to Division 7 (overseas portability).

        * Note 3: This section is subject to sections 10 (grace period for farmers' partners) and 12 (no effective control of farm enterprises).

##### 10  Grace period for farmers' partners

    * (1) This section applies if:

     * (a) a person was qualified for farm household allowance under section 9 as a partner of a farmer; and

     * (b) the person would (apart from this section) have ceased to be qualified for farm household allowance on a day (the **_grace period start day_**) only because:

      * (i) the person ceased to be a member of a couple on that day; or

      * (ii) the person's partner was in gaol or undergoing psychiatric confinement on that day, and could not contribute a significant part of his or her labour or capital to a farm enterprise as a result of the imprisonment or confinement.

    * (2) The person remains qualified under section 9 for farm household allowance for the period:

     * (a) starting on the grace period start day; and

     * (b) ending on the earlier of the following days:

      * (i) the day the person otherwise ceases to be qualified for farm household allowance under that section;

      * (ii) the day that is 14 weeks after the grace period start day.

##### 11  Persons with temporary incapacity exemption may be taken to meet the labour requirement

    * A person who is exempt from the activity test under section 31 (temporary incapacity) for a period is taken to contribute a significant part of his or her labour to a farm enterprise during the period if the person contributed a significant part of his or her labour to the farm enterprise immediately before becoming incapacitated.

##### 12  Persons not qualified if Secretary determines that they do not effectively control farm enterprises

    * (1) A person is not qualified, or ceases to be qualified, for farm household allowance for a period if the Secretary determines that:

     * (a) during the period:

      * (i) for a person who qualifies under section 8 as a farmer--the person is not effectively in control of the farm or farm enterprise in relation to which the person claims the allowance; or

      * (ii) for a person who qualifies under section 9 as a partner of a farmer--the farmer is not effectively in control of the farm or farm enterprise in relation to which the person claims the allowance; and

     * (b) farm household allowance should not be payable to the person for the period.

        * Note	Some examples of cases in which the Secretary may consider that a person is not effectively in control of a farm or farm enterprise are when a mortgagee has taken possession of a farm, when a person is a bankrupt or when an eviction notice has been served on a person in respect of a farm.

    * (2) A person may effectively be in control of a farm enterprise that is a designated private trust even if the person does not pass the control test in relation to the farm enterprise under section 1207V of the Social Security Act.

##### 13  Determination of matters relating to qualification for farm household allowance

    * (1) The Secretary's rules may prescribe matters the Secretary must take into account in deciding whether the requirement in paragraph 8(b) or (c), or paragraph 9(d) or (e), is met.

    * (2) To avoid doubt, the Secretary's rules do not limit the matters the Secretary may take into account in deciding whether the requirement is met.

#### Division 3--Financial improvement agreements

##### 14  Requirement to enter financial improvement agreement

    * (1) The Secretary may require a person to enter a financial improvement agreement if:

     * (a) such an agreement is not already in force in relation to the person; and

     * (b) either:

      * (i) the person is receiving, or has made a claim for, farm household allowance; or

      * (ii) the Department is contacted by or on behalf of the person in relation to a claim for farm household allowance.

    * (2) The Secretary may require a person to enter into another financial improvement agreement if a financial improvement agreement is already in force in relation to the person.

        * Note: The earlier financial improvement agreement is cancelled in accordance with section 17.

    * Giving notice of requirement

    * (3) The Secretary must give a person who is required to enter a financial improvement agreement written notice of:

     * (a) the requirement; and

     * (b) the places and times at which the agreement is to be negotiated; and

### Part 5--Application and modification of the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 90  Simplified outline of this Part

    * This Part notionally modifies how the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act operate, so that those Acts can apply in relation to payments made under this Act.

    * Farm household allowance is generally treated in the same way as newstart and youth allowance. This means that where there is a reference in those Acts to newstart or youth allowance, it is as if there were also a reference to farm household allowance. Similarly, where there is a reference to a concept that is defined to include those allowances, such as "social security benefit" or "social security payment", it is as if that concept were also defined to include farm household allowance.

    * The farm household allowance, the activity supplement and the farm financial assessment supplement are all treated as if they were social security payments. As a result, the general rules in the Social Security Act and Social Security Administration Act relating to how to make claims, how payments are made and review of decisions apply in relation payments under this Act.

    * In order for those Acts to operate appropriately in relation to this Act, some provisions of those Acts are notionally turned off, and the text of other provisions of the Acts is notionally changed.

    * The modifications of concepts in the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act flow through to other Acts, such as the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1936_ and the _Income Tax Assessment Act 1997_ as a result of this Part.

##### 91  Purposes of this Part

    * (1) This Part modifies the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act so that those Acts apply in relation to payments made under this Act.

    * (2) The modifications apply for the purposes of the following Acts (including any regulations or other legislative instruments made under those Acts):

     * (a) this Act;

     * (b) the Social Security Act;

     * (c) the Social Security Administration Act;

     * (d) any other Act that refers to the Social Security Act or the Social Security Administration Act.

    * (3) To avoid doubt, when an Act (the **_relevant Act_**) other than the Social Security Act:

     * (a) uses an expression that is also used in all or part of the Social Security Act; and

     * (b) gives the expression the same meaning as in that Act or part; and

     * (c) the expression is modified by section 93 of this Act;

    * the expression when used in the relevant Act has the modified meaning.

        * Example: Subsection 3(2) of the Social Security Administration Act gives expressions used in that Act the same meaning as in the Social Security Act. So, for example, a reference in the Social Security Administration Act to a social security payment is taken, as a result of this Part, to include a reference to farm household allowance, activity supplement and farm financial assessment supplement.

##### 92  Further modification of the Social Security Act and the Social Security Administration Act

    * (1) The Minister's rules may provide that:

     * (a) this Part; or

     * (b) the Social Security Act; or

     * (c) the Social Security Administration Act;

    * has effect for the purposes set out in section 91 of this Act with any modifications that are prescribed.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Minister's rules may:

     * (a) prescribe additional provisions of the Social Security Act or the Social Security Administration Act that do not apply, or that apply with modifications that are prescribed, in relation to the operation of this Act; or

     * (b) prescribe provisions referred to in section 94 or 98 of this Act that, despite those sections, apply in relation to the operation of this Act; or

     * (c) make further modifications of provisions already modified by section 95 or 99 of this Act.
