### Part X--International liner cargo shipping

#### Division 1--Preliminary

##### 10.01  Objects of Part

    * (1) The principal objects of this Part are:

     * (a) to ensure that Australian exporters have continued access to outwards liner cargo shipping services of adequate frequency and reliability at freight rates that are internationally competitive; and

     * (b) to promote conditions in the international liner cargo shipping industry that encourage stable access to export markets for exporters in all States and Territories; and

     * (c) to ensure that efficient Australian flag shipping is not unreasonably hindered from normal commercial participation in any outwards liner cargo shipping trade; and

     * (d) as far as practicable, to extend to Australian importers in each State and Territory the protection given by this Part to Australian exporters.

    * (2) It is the intention of the Parliament that the principal objects of this Part should be achieved:

     * (a) by permitting continued conference operations while enhancing the competitive environment for international liner cargo shipping services through the provision of adequate and appropriate safeguards against abuse of conference power, particularly by:

      * (i) enacting additional restrictive trade practice provisions applying to ocean carriers;

      * (ii) requiring conference agreements to meet certain minimum standards;

      * (iii) making conference agreements generally publicly available;

      * (iv) permitting only partial and conditional exemption from restrictive trade practice prohibitions; and

      * (v) requiring conferences to take part in negotiations with representative shipper bodies;

     * (b) through increased reliance on private commercial and legal processes and a reduced level of government regulation of routine commercial matters; and

     * (c) by the exercise of jurisdiction, consistent with international law:

      * (i) over ocean carriers who have a substantial connection with  because they provide international liner cargo shipping services; and

      * (ii) to enable remedies for contravention of the provisions of this Part to be enforced within .

##### 10.01A  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

     *  	This Part sets up a system for regulating international liner cargo shipping services.

     *  	The main components of that system are as follows: 

        * (a) registration of conference agreements;

        * (b) regulation of nonconference ocean carriers with substantial market power;

        * (c) regulation of unfair pricing practices;

        * (d) registration of agents of ocean carriers.

     *  	The parties to a conference agreement relating to international liner cargo shipping services may apply for the registration of the agreement.

     *  	If the conference agreement is registered, the parties will be given partial and conditional exemptions from:

        * (a) sections 44ZZRF, 44ZZRG, 44ZZRJ and 44ZZRK (cartel conduct); and

        * (b) section 45 (contracts etc. that restrict dealings or affect competition); and

        * (c) section 47 (exclusive dealing).

     *  	The parties to a registered conference agreement are required to negotiate with, and provide information to, representative shipper bodies.

     *  	The Commission may investigate whether grounds exist for the Minister to deregister a conference agreement.

     *  	The main ground for deregistration is a breach by the parties to the agreement of requirements imposed on them by this Part.

#### Division 7--Remedies

##### 137  Limit on occupational liability

    * State or Territory professional standards law limits liability

    * (1) A professional standards law of a State, the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory applies to limit occupational liability relating to an action for a contravention of section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law in the same way as it limits occupational liability arising under a law of the State or Territory.

    * (2) However, the professional standards law applies for that purpose:

     * (a) only in relation to a scheme that was prescribed by the regulations at the time (the **_contravention time_**) of the contravention; and

     * (b) as if the scheme were in force under that law at the contravention time, in the form the scheme would have been in if:

      * (i) the scheme had not been amended or revoked under that law since the scheme was first prescribed; and

      * (ii) any additions, omissions, substitutions and other modifications prescribed by the regulations at the contravention time had been made to the scheme.

    * Operation of choice of law rules

    * (3) For the purposes of working out whether a professional standards law of a particular State or Territory applies under subsection (1) in relation to a particular contravention of section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law, choice of law rules operate in relation to the contravention in the same way as they operate in relation to a tort.

    * Professional standards laws

    * (4) A **_professional standards law_** is a law that provides for the limitation of occupational liability by reference to schemes for limiting that liability that were formulated and published in accordance with that law.

    * Occupational liability

    * (5) **_Occupational liability_** is civil liability arising directly or vicariously from anything done or omitted by a person who:

     * (a) does or omits to do the thing in the course of his or her profession, trade or occupation; and

     * (b) is a member of a body:

     * (a) an act or omission of:

      * (i) the individual who suffers the injuries referred to in that section; or

      * (ii) a person for whom that individual is responsible; and

     * (b) a safety defect of the goods to which the action relates;

    * the amount of the loss or damage is to be reduced to such extent (which may be to nil) as the court thinks fit having regard to that individual's share in the responsibility for the loss or damage.

    * (2) If the loss or damage to which a defective goods action under section 140 or 141 of the Australian Consumer Law relates was caused by both:

     * (a) an act or omission of:

      * (ii) another person for whom that person is responsible; and

     * (b) a safety defect of the goods to which the action relates;

    * the amount of the loss or damage is to be reduced to such extent (which may be to nil) as the court thinks fit having regard to the person's share in the responsibility for the loss or damage.

##### 137B  Reduction of the amount of loss or damage if the claimant fails to take reasonable care

     * (a) a person (the **_claimant_**) makes a claim under subsection 236(1) of the Australian Consumer Law in relation to economic loss, or damage to property, suffered by the claimant because of the conduct of another person; and

     * (b) the conduct contravened section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law; and

     * (c) the claimant suffered the loss or damage as result:

      * (i) partly of the claimant's failure to take reasonable care; and

      * (ii) partly of the conduct of the other person; and

     * (d) the other person did not intend to cause the loss or damage and did not fraudulently cause the loss or damage;

    * the amount of the loss or damage that the claimant may recover under subsection 236(1) of the Australian Consumer Law is to be reduced to the extent to which a court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the loss or damage.

##### 137C  Limits on recovery of amounts for death or personal injury

    * (1) A person is not entitled to recover an amount of loss or damage by action under subsection 236(1) of the Australian Consumer Law to the extent to which:

    * as if the action were a proceeding to which Part VIB of this Act applied.

        * Note 1: Division 2 of Part VIB of this Act deals with the limitation periods that apply for claims for damages or compensation for death or personal injury and, to the extent to which that Division is applied to the action by this subsection, it overrides subsection 236(2) of the Australian Consumer Law.

     * (a) the action would be based on the conduct contravening a provision of Part 21 or 31 of the Australian Consumer Law; and

     * (b) the loss or damage is, or results from, death or personal injury; and

     * (c) the death or personal injury results from smoking or other use of tobacco products;

    * as if the proceeding in relation to the application were a proceeding to which Part VIB of this Act applies and as if the making of the application were the commencement of the proceeding.

        * Note: Division 2 of Part VIB of this Act deals with the limitation periods that apply for claims for damages or compensation for death or personal injury and, to the extent to which that Division is applied to the application by this subsection, it overrides subsection 237(3) of the Australian Consumer Law.

    * (3) Division 7 of Part VIB of this Act applies to a proceeding in which an order under subsection 237(1) or 238(1) of the Australian Consumer Law to compensate a person for loss or damage the person suffers because of the conduct of another person is made, to the extent to which:

### Part XIB--The Telecommunications Industry: Anticompetitive conduct and recordkeeping rules

#### Division 1--Introduction

##### 151AA  Simplified outline

    * The following is a simplified outline of this Part: 

     *  	This Part sets up a special regime for regulating anticompetitive conduct in the telecommunications industry. The regime applies in addition to Part IV.

     *  	The Part sets out the circumstances in which carriers and carriage service providers are said to **_engage in anticompetitive conduct_**.

     *  	A carrier or carriage service provider must not engage in anticompetitive conduct. This rule is called the **_competition rule_**.

     *  	The Commission may issue a notice stating that a specified carrier or carriage service provider has engaged, or is engaging, in anticompetitive conduct. The notice is called a **_Part A competition notice_**.

     *  	Proceedings for the enforcement of the competition rule (other than proceedings for injunctive relief) must not be instituted unless the alleged conduct is of a kind dealt with in a Part A competition notice that was in force at the time when the alleged conduct occurred.

     *  	The Commission may issue a notice stating that a specified carrier or carriage service provider has contravened, or is contravening, the competition rule. The notice is called a **_Part B competition notice_**.

     *  	A Part B competition notice is prima facie evidence of the matters in the notice.

     *  	The Commission may make an order exempting specified conduct from the scope of the definition of **_anticompetitive conduct_**. The order is called an **_exemption order_**.

     *  	Carriers and carriage service providers may be directed to file tariff information with the Commission. The direction is called a **_tariff filing direction_**.

     *  	The Commission may make recordkeeping rules that apply to carriers and carriage service providers.

     *  	Carriers and carriage service providers may be directed by the Commission to make certain reports available. The direction is called a **_disclosure direction_**.

     *  	A carriage service, or a related service, supplied, or capable of being supplied, by a carrier (other than an NBN corporation) or a carriage service provider (other than an NBN corporation) is a **_declared service_** if:

        * (a) the Commission has declared the service to be a **_declared service_**; or

        * (b) the service is supplied by the carrier or carriage service provider, and a special access undertaking given by the carrier or carriage service provider is in operation in relation to the service.

     *  	A carriage service, or a related service, supplied, or capable of being supplied, by an NBN corporation is a **_declared service_** if:

        * (a) the Commission has declared the service to be a **_declared service_**; or

        * (b) the NBN corporation has formulated a standard form of access agreement that relates to access to the service; or

        * (c) the service is supplied by the NBN corporation, and a special access undertaking given by the NBN corporation is in operation in relation to the service.

     *  	Carriers and carriage service providers who provide declared services are required to comply with **_standard access obligations_** in relation to those services.

     *  	The **_standard access obligations_** facilitate the provision of access to declared services by service providers in order that service providers can provide carriage services and/or content services.

     *  	The terms and conditions on which carriers and carriage service providers are required to comply with the **_standard access obligations_** are subject to agreement.

     *  	If agreement cannot be reached, but the carrier or carriage service provider has given an **_access undertaking_**, the terms and conditions are as set out in the access undertaking. 

     *  	If agreement cannot be reached, no access undertaking is in operation, but the Commission has made binding rules of conduct, the terms and conditions are as specified in the binding rules of conduct.

     *  	If agreement cannot be reached, no access undertaking is in operation, and no binding rules of conduct have been made, the terms and conditions are as specified in an access determination made by the Commission.

     *  	A carrier, carriage service provider or related body must not prevent or hinder the fulfilment of a standard access obligation.

        * Note: Even though this section mentions binding rules of conduct, binding rules of conduct may only be made if the Commission considers that there is an urgent need to do so.

     * (b) preventing a carrier or carriage service provider from obtaining a sufficient amount of the service to be able to meet the carrier's or provider's reasonably anticipated requirements, measured at the time when the access seeker made a request in relation to the service under section 152AR or 152AXB;
