     * (b) the legislative powers that the Commonwealth Parliament has in respect of matters to which this Act relates because those matters are referred to it by the Parliaments of the referring States under paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution.

##### 4  Referring States

    * Reference of matters by State Parliament to Commonwealth Parliament

    * (1) A State is a **_referring State_** if the Parliament of the State has referred the matters covered by subsections (4) and (5) to the Parliament of the Commonwealth for the purposes of paragraph 51(xxxvii) of the Constitution:

    * (3) A State is a **_referring State_** even if a law of the State provides that the reference to the Commonwealth Parliament of either or both of the matters covered by subsections (4) and (5) is to terminate in particular circumstances.

    * Reference covering initial Corporations Act and ASIC Act

    * (4) This subsection covers the matters to which the referred provisions relate to the extent of making laws with respect to those matters by including the referred provisions in the initial Corporations Act and the initial ASIC Act.

    * Reference covering amendments of this Act and ASIC Act

    * (5) This subsection covers the matters of the formation of corporations, corporate regulation and the regulation of financial products and services to the extent of the making of laws with respect to those matters by making express amendments of this Act or the ASIC Act.

    * Effect of termination of reference

    * (6) A State ceases to be a **_referring State_** if the State's initial reference terminates.

    * (7) A State ceases to be a **_referring State_** if:

##### 5E  Concurrent operation intended

    * (1) The Corporations legislation is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory.

    * (2) Without limiting subsection (1), the Corporations legislation is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a law of a State or Territory that:

       * (i) a director or other officer of a company or other corporation; or

       * (ii) a company or other body; or

     * (b) confers additional powers on:

       * (i) a director or other officer of a company or other corporation; or

       * (ii) a company or other body; or

     * (c) provides for the formation of a body corporate; or

     * (d) imposes additional limits on the interests a person may hold or acquire in a company or other body; or

     * (e) prevents a person from:

       * (i) being a director of; or

    * (4) This section does not apply to the law of the State or Territory if there is a direct inconsistency between the Corporations legislation and that law.

         * Note: Section 5G prevents direct inconsistencies arising in some cases by limiting the operation of the Corporations legislation.

    * (5) If:

     * (a) an act or omission of a person is both an offence against the Corporations legislation and an offence under the law of a State or Territory; and

     * (b) the person is convicted of either of those offences;

    * the person is not liable to be convicted of the other of those offences.

##### 5F  Corporations legislation does not apply to matters declared by State or Territory law to be an excluded matter

    * (1) Subsection (2) applies if a provision of a law of a State or Territory declares a matter to be an excluded matter for the purposes of this section in relation to:

     * (a) the whole of the Corporations legislation; or

     * (b) a specified provision of the Corporations legislation; or

     * (c) the Corporations legislation other than a specified provision; or

     * (d) the Corporations legislation otherwise than to a specified extent.

    * (2) By force of this subsection:

     * (a) none of the provisions of the Corporations legislation (other than this section) applies in the State or Territory in relation to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(a) applies; and

     * (b) the specified provision of the Corporations legislation does not apply in the State or Territory in relation to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(b) applies; and

     * (c) the provisions of the Corporations legislation (other than this section and the specified provisions) do not apply in the State or Territory in relation to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(c) applies; and

     * (d) the provisions of the Corporations legislation (other than this section and otherwise than to the specified extent) do not apply in the State or Territory in relation to the matter if the declaration is one to which paragraph (1)(d) applies.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not apply to the declaration to the extent to which the regulations provide that that subsection does not apply to that declaration.

    * (4) By force of this subsection, if:

     * (a) the Corporations Law, ASC Law or ASIC Law of a State or Territory; or

     * (b) a provision of that Law;

    * did not apply to a matter immediately before this Act commenced because a provision of a law of the State or Territory provided that that Law, or that provision, did not apply to the matter, the Corporations legislation, or the provision of the Corporations legislation that corresponds to that provision of that Law, does not apply in the State or Territory to the matter until that law of the State or Territory is omitted or repealed.

    * (5) Subsection (4) does not apply to the application of the provisions of the Corporations legislation to the matter to the extent to which the regulations provide that that subsection does not apply to the matter.

    * (6) In this section:

##### 5G  Avoiding direct inconsistency arising between the Corporations legislation and State and Territory laws

    * Section overrides other provisions of the Corporations legislation

    * (1) This section has effect despite anything else in the Corporations legislation.

    * Section does not deal with provisions capable of concurrent operation

    * (2) This section does not apply to a provision of a law of a State or Territory that is capable of concurrent operation with the Corporations legislation.

         * Note: This kind of provision is dealt with by section 5E.

    * When this section applies to a provision of a State or Territory law

    * (3) This section applies to the interaction between:

     * (a) a provision of a law of a State or Territory (the **_State provision_**); and

     * (b) a provision of the Corporations legislation (the **_Commonwealth provision_**);

    * only if the State provision meets the conditions set out in the following table: 

         * Note 1: Item 1--subsection (12) tells you when a provision is a precommencement (commenced) provision.

         * Note 2: Item 1 paragraph (a)--For example, a State or Territory provision enacted after the commencement of the Corporations Law might not have operated despite the Corporations Law if it was not expressly provided that the provision was to operate despite a specified provision, or despite any provision, of the Corporations Law (see, for example, section 5 of the Corporations (New South Wales) Act 1990).

         * Note 3: Item 2--subsection (13) tells you when a provision is a precommencement (enacted) provision.

         * Note 4: Item 3--subsection (14) tells you when a provision is a postcommencement provision.

         * Note 5: Subsections (15) to (17) tell you when a provision is materially amended after commencement.

    * State and Territory laws specifically authorising or requiring act or thing to be done

    * (4) A provision of the Corporations legislation does not:

     * (a) prohibit the doing of an act; or

     * (b) impose a liability (whether civil or criminal) for doing an act;

    * if a provision of a law of a State or Territory specifically authorises or requires the doing of that act.

    * Instructions given to directors under State and Territory laws

    * (5) If a provision of a law of a State or Territory specifically:

### Part 1.5--Small business guide

    * This guide summarises the main rules in the Corporations Act (the _Corporations Act 2001_) that apply to proprietary companies limited by shares--the most common type of company used by small business. The guide gives a general overview of the Corporations Act as it applies to those companies and directs readers to the operative provisions in the Corporations Act.

    * The notes in square brackets at the end of paragraphs in the guide indicate the main provisions of the Corporations Act, the regulations made under the Corporations Act, and ASIC Practice Notes that are relevant to the information in the paragraphs.

    * Other Commonwealth, State and Territory laws also impose obligations on proprietary companies and their operators.

##### 1  What registration means

    * 1.1 Separate legal entity that has its own powers

    * As far as the law is concerned, a company has a separate legal existence that is distinct from that of its owners, managers, operators, employees and agents. A company has its own property, its own rights and its own obligations. A company's money and other assets belong to the company and must be used for the company's purposes.

    * A company has the powers of an individual, including the powers to:

      *  	own and dispose of property and other assets

      *  	enter into contracts

      *  	sue and be sued.

    * Once a company is registered, its separate legal status, property, rights and liabilities continue until ASIC (Australian Securities and Investments Commission) deregisters the company.

         * [sections 119, 124--125, 601AA--601AD]

    * 1.2 Limited liability of shareholders

    * Shareholders of a company are not liable (in their capacity as shareholders) for the company's debts. As shareholders, their only obligation is to pay the company any amount unpaid on their shares if they are called upon to do so. However, particularly if a shareholder is also a director, this limitation may be affected by other laws and the commercial practices discussed in 1.3 and 1.4.

         * [section 516]

    * 1.3 Director's liability for company's debts

    * A director of a company may be liable for debts incurred by the company at a time when the company itself is unable to pay those debts as they fall due.

    * A director of a company may be liable to compensate the company for any losses the company suffers from a breach of certain of the director's duties to the company (see 5.3).

    * In addition to having liability for the company's debts or to pay compensation to the company, a director may also be subject to a civil penalty.

    * If a company holds property on trust, a director of the company may be liable in some circumstances for liabilities incurred by the company as trustee.

         * [sections 197, 344, 588G, 588J, 588M, 1317H]

    * 1.4 Director's liability as guarantor/security over personal assets

    * As a matter of commercial practice, a bank, trade creditor or anyone else providing finance or credit to a company may ask a director of the company:

      *  	for a personal guarantee of the company's liabilities; and

      *  	for some form of security over their house or personal assets to secure the performance by the company of its obligations.

    * The director of a company may, for example, be asked by a bank to give a mortgage over their house to secure the company's repayment of a loan. If the company does not repay the loan as agreed with the bank, the director may lose the house.

    * 1.5 Continuous existence

    * A company continues to exist even if 1 or more of its shareholders or directors sells their shares, dies or leaves the company. If a company has only 1 shareholder who is also the only director of the company and that person dies, their personal representative is able to ensure that the company continues to operate.

         * [sections 119, 224A]

    * 1.6 Rules for the internal management of a company

    * The Corporations Act contains a basic set of rules for the internal management of a company (appointments, meetings etc.).

    * Some of these rules are mandatory for all companies. There are a few special rules for single shareholder/single director companies.

    * Other internal management rules in the Corporations Act are replaceable rules. The replaceable rules do not apply to:

      *  	a single shareholder/single director company; or

      *  	a company that had a constitution before the introduction of the replaceable rules regime and has not repealed it.

    * A company does not need to have a separate constitution of its own; it can simply take advantage of the rules in the Corporations Act. The company will need a constitution only if it wants to displace, modify or add to the replaceable rules.

         * [sections 134141 and 198E]

    * 1.7 How a company acts

    * A company does not have a physical existence. It must act through other people.

    * Individual directors, the company secretary, company employees or agents may be authorised to enter into contracts that bind the company (see 7).

    * In some circumstances, a company will be bound by something done by another person (see 1.8).

    * 1.8 Directors

    * The directors of a company are responsible for managing the company's business. It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that generally the directors may exercise all the powers of the company except a power that the Corporations Act, a replaceable rule or a provision of the company's constitution (if any) requires the company to exercise in general meeting.

    * The only director of a company who is also the only shareholder is responsible for managing the company's business and may exercise all of the company's powers.

    * The Corporations Act sets out rules dealing with the calling and conduct of directors' meetings. Directors must keep a written record (minutes) of their resolutions and meetings.

    * There are 2 ways that directors may pass resolutions: 

      *  	at a meeting; or

      *  	by having all of the directors record and sign their decision.

    * If a company has only 1 director, the sole director may also pass a resolution by recording and signing their decision.

         * [sections 198A, 198E, 202C, subsection 202F(1), sections 248A248G, 251A]

    * 1.9 Shareholders

    * The shareholders of a company own the company, but the company has a separate legal existence and the company's assets belong to the company.

    * Shareholders can make decisions about the company by passing a resolution, usually at a meeting. A "special resolution" usually involves more important questions affecting the company as a whole or the rights of some or all of its shareholders.

    * There are 2 ways that shareholders may pass a resolution: 

      *  	at a meeting; or

      *  	by having all of the shareholders record and sign their decision.

    * If a meeting is held, an ordinary resolution must be passed by a majority of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled to vote on the resolution at the meeting in person or by proxy (if proxies are allowed). A special resolution must be passed by at least 75% of the votes cast by shareholders of the company entitled to vote on the resolution and who vote at the meeting in person or by proxy (if proxies are allowed).

    * The sole shareholder of a company may pass a resolution by recording and signing their decision.

    * A company must keep a written record (minutes) of the members' resolutions and meetings.

         * [sections 9 (**_special resolution_**), 249A, 249B, 249L, 251A]

    * 1.10 What others can assume about the company

    * Anyone who does any business with the company is entitled to assume that the company has a legal right to conduct that business unless the person knows, or suspects, otherwise. For example, an outsider dealing with the company is entitled to assume:

      *  	that a person who is shown in a notice lodged with ASIC as being the director or company secretary of a company has been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the company; and

      *  	that a person who is held out by the company to be a director, company secretary or agent of the company has been properly appointed and is authorised to act for the company.

         * [sections 128--130]

##### 2  The company structure for small business

    * 2.1 Proprietary company for small business

    * Generally, a proprietary company limited by shares is the most suitable company for use by small business. Such a proprietary company must have a least 1 shareholder but no more than 50 shareholders (not counting employee shareholders). It may have 1 or more directors.

         * [sections 112--113]

##### 3  Setting up a new company

    * The operators of small businesses can either buy "shelf" companies or set up new companies themselves.

    * 3.1 "Shelf" companies

    * The operator of a small business may find it more convenient to buy a "shelf" company (a company that has already been registered but has not traded) from businesses which set up companies for this purpose or from some legal or accounting firms.

    * 3.2 Setting up a company

    * To set up a new company themselves, the operator must apply to ASIC for registration of the company.

    * A proprietary company limited by shares must have at least 1 shareholder.

    * To obtain registration, a person must lodge a properly completed application form with ASIC. The form must set out certain information including details of every person who has consented to be a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company.

    * The company comes into existence when ASIC registers it.

         * [sections 117--119, 135--136, 140]

    * 3.3 ACN and name

    * When a company is registered, ASIC allocates to it a unique 9 digit number called the Australian Company Number (ACN). (For use of the ACN see 4.1).

    * In practice, a new company must have a name that is different from the name of a company that is already registered. A proprietary company limited by shares must have the words "Proprietary Limited" as part of its name. Those words can be abbreviated to "Pty Ltd".

    * A proprietary company may adopt its ACN as its name. If it does so, its name must also contain the words "Australian Company Number" (which can be abbreviated to "ACN"). For example, the company's name might be "ACN 123 456 789 Pty Ltd".

         * [sections 119, 147--161]

    * 3.4 Contracts entered into before the company is registered

    * A company can ratify a contract entered into by someone on its behalf or for its benefit before it was registered. If the company does not ratify the contract, the person who entered into the contract may be personally liable.

         * [sections 131--133]

    * 3.5 First shareholders, directors and company secretary

    * A person listed with their consent as a shareholder, director or company secretary in the application for registration of the company becomes a shareholder, director or company secretary of the company on its registration.

    * The same person may be both a director of the company and the company secretary.

    * See 5.1 and 5.2 for directors and 5.4 for company secretaries. See 6.1 for shareholders.

         * [section 120]

    * 3.6 Issuing shares

    * It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that, before issuing new shares, a company must first offer them to the existing shareholders in the proportions that the shareholders already hold. A company may issue shares at a price it determines.

         * [sections 254B, 254D]

    * 3.7 Registered office

    * A company must have a registered office in  and must inform ASIC of the location of the office. A post office box cannot be the registered office of a company. The purpose of the registered office is to have a place where all communications and notices to the company may be sent.

    * If the company does not occupy the premises where its registered office is located, the occupier of the premises must agree in writing to having the company's registered office located there.

    * A proprietary company is not required to open its registered office to the public but this does not affect its obligation to make documents available for inspection.

    * The company must notify ASIC of any change of address of its registered office.

         * [sections 100, 142, 143, 173, 1300]

    * 3.8 Principal place of business

    * If a company has a principal place of business that is different from its registered office, it must notify ASIC of the address of its principal place of business and of any changes to that address.

         * [sections 117, 146]

    * 3.9 Registers kept by the company

    * A company must keep registers, including a register of shareholders. A company must keep its registers at:

      *  	the company's registered office; or

      *  	the company's principal place of business; or

      *  	a place (whether on premises of the company or of someone else) where the work in maintaining the register is done; or

      *  	another place approved by ASIC.

    * A register may be kept either in a bound or looseleaf book or on computer.

    * If a register is kept on computer, its contents must be capable of being printed out in hard copy.

         * [sections 172, 1300, 1301, 1306]

    * 3.10 Register of shareholders

    * A company must keep in its register of shareholders such information as: 

      *  	the names and addresses of its shareholders; and

      *  	details of shares held by individual shareholders.

         * [sections 168--169]

##### 4  Continuing obligations after the company is set up

    * The Corporations Act and other laws impose obligations on companies themselves and on their directors and company secretaries. Some of the more important obligations imposed under the Corporations Act are discussed below.

    * 4.1 Use of company name and ACN

    * The name of a company must be shown at all the company's business premises (including its registered office) that are open to the public. The company's name and its ACN or ABN (if the last 9 digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits of its ACN) must appear:

      *  	on some of its public documents; and

      *  	on its cheques and negotiable instruments; and

      *  	on all documents lodged with ASIC; and

      *  	if it has one, on its common seal.

         * ASIC Practice Note 47]


    * 4.2 Extract of particulars

    * Each year, ASIC issues each company with an extract of particulars within 2 weeks of the company's review date (which is generally the anniversary of the company's registration). The extract includes details recorded on ASIC's database such as:

      *  	names and addresses of each director and company secretary;

      *  	issued shares and options granted;

      *  	details of its shareholders;

      *  	address of its registered office;

      *  	address of its principal place of business.

    * If any of the details are not correct as at the date the extract is received, the company must correct those details.

    * The correction may be lodged with ASIC on a printed form or, if an agreement is in place to lodge electronically, in accordance with the agreement.

         * [Sections 346A and 346C, 352]

    * 4.3 Review fee

    * A director must consent in writing to holding the position of director. The company must keep the consent and must notify ASIC of the appointment.

    * In some circumstances, the Corporations Act imposes the duties and obligations of a director on a person who, although not formally appointed as a director of a company, nevertheless acts as a director or gives instructions to the formally appointed directors as to how they should act.

    * The Court or ASIC may prohibit a person from being a director or from otherwise being involved in the management of a company if, for example, the person has breached the Corporations Act.

    * A person needs the Court's permission to be a director if the person has been convicted of certain offences or is, in some circumstances, unable to pay their debts as they fall due.

    * Generally, a director may resign by giving notice of the resignation to the company. A director who resigns may notify ASIC of the resignation. If the director does not do so, the company must notify ASIC of the director's resignation.

         * [sections 9, 201A, 201B, 201D, 205A, 205B and 206A206G, 228230 and 242 and subsection 1317EA(3)]

      *  	notifies ASIC about changes to the identities, names and addresses of the company's directors and company secretaries; and

      *  	notifies ASIC about changes to the register of members; and

      *  	notifies ASIC about changes to any ultimate holding company; and

      *  	the company issuing shares to the person

      *  	the person buying shares in the company from an existing shareholder and the company registering the transfer.

    * Some of the ways in which a person ceases to be a shareholder are: 

      *  	the person sells all of their shares in the company and the company registers the transfer of the shares

      *  	the company buys back all the person's shares

      *  	ASIC cancels the company's registration.

         * [sections 117, 120, 601AA--601AD]

      *  	for a company with a sole director who is also the sole secretary--that director.

    * If the document is to have effect as a deed, it should be expressed to be a deed.

         * [sections 126--127]

    * A company is not required to have a common seal. If it does, the seal must show the company's name and its ACN or ABN (if the last 9 digits are the same, and in the same order, as the last 9 digits of its ACN). The seal is equivalent to the company's signature and may be used on important company documents such as mortgages.

         * [sections 123, 127(2)]

##### 8  Funding the company's operations

    * The shareholders may fund the company's operations by lending money to the company or by taking up other shares in the company.

    * The company may also borrow money from banks and other financial organisations.

    * Anyone who has lent money, or provided credit, to the company may ask for a security interest in the company's assets to secure the performance by the company of its obligations.

         * [sections 113, 124]

##### 9  Returns to shareholders

    * Shareholders can take money out of the company in a number of ways, but only if the company complies with its constitution (if any), the Corporations Act and all other relevant laws.

      *  	to pay compensation; and

         * [sections 588G, 1317E, 1317G, 1317H, 1317P]

    * 9.1 Dividends

    * Dividends are payments to shareholders. They can only be paid if:

      *  	the company's assets are sufficiently in excess of its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared; and

      *  	the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole and does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors.

    * It is a replaceable rule (see 1.6) that the directors decide whether the company should pay a dividend.

         * [sections 254T, 254U]

##### 10  Annual financial reports and audit

    * 10.1 The small/large distinction

    * The accounting requirements imposed on a proprietary company under the Corporations Act depend on whether the company is classified as small or large. A company's classification can change from 1 financial year to another as its circumstances change.

    * A company is classified as small for a financial year if it satisfies at least 2 of the following tests: 

      *  	gross operating revenue of less than $10 million for the year

      *  	gross assets of less than $5 million at the end of the year

      *  	fewer than 50 employees at the end of the year.

    * A company that does not satisfy at least 2 of these tests is classified as large.

         * [section 45A]

    * As the great majority of proprietary companies are small under these tests, the discussion below deals mainly with the accounting requirements for small proprietary companies.

         * [sections 286--301]

    * 10.2 Financial records

    * Under the Corporations Act, all proprietary companies must keep sufficient financial records to record and explain their transactions and financial position and to allow true and fair financial statements to be prepared and audited. **_Financial record_** here means some kind of systematic record of the company's financial transactions--not merely a collection of receipts, invoices, bank statements and cheque butts. Financial records may be kept on computer.

         * [sections 286--289]

    * 10.3 Preparing annual financial reports and directors' reports

    * The Corporations Act requires a small proprietary company to prepare an annual financial report (an annual profit and loss statement, a balance sheet and a statement of cash flows) and a directors' report (about the company's operations, dividends paid or recommended, options issued etc.) if:

      *  	the shareholders with at least 5% of the votes in the company direct it to do so; or

      *  	ASIC directs it to do so.

    * Unless the shareholders' direction specifies otherwise, the company must prepare the annual financial report in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.

    * Although the Corporations Act itself may not require a small proprietary company to prepare a financial report except in the circumstances mentioned, the company may need to prepare the annual financial reports for the purposes of other laws (for example, income tax laws). Moreover, good business practice may also make it advisable for the company to prepare the financial reports so that it can monitor and better manage its financial position.

    * Large proprietary companies must prepare annual financial reports and a directors' report, have the financial report audited and send both reports to shareholders. They must also lodge the annual financial reports with ASIC unless exempted.

         * [sections 286--301, 319--320]

##### 11  Disagreements within the company

    * 11.1 Special problems faced by minority shareholders

    * There are remedies available to a shareholder of a company if: 

      *  	the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way that is unfair to that shareholder or to other shareholders of the company; or

      *  	the affairs of the company are being conducted in a way that is against the interests of the company as a whole.

    *  may, for example, order the winding up of a company or the appointment of a receiver.

         * [sections 232235, 461]

    * 11.2 Buy--back of shares

    * A company may buy back the shares of a shareholder who wants to sever their relationship with the company.

         * [sections 257A--257J]

    * 11.3 Selling shares

    * A shareholder in a company who wants to sever their relationship with the company may decide to sell their shares. However, the shareholder may not be able to sell their shares readily--particularly if they want to sell their shares to someone who is not an existing shareholder. Some of the difficulties they may face in that case are:

      *  	under the replaceable rules the directors have a discretion to refuse to transfer the shares; and

      *  	restrictions in the company's constitution (if any) on transferring shares.

         * [sections 707, 1041H, 1091D1091E]

##### 12  Companies in financial trouble

    * 12.1 Voluntary administration

    * If a company experiences financial problems, the directors may appoint an administrator to take over the operations of the company to see if the company's creditors and the company can work out a solution to the company's problems.

    * If the company's creditors and the company cannot agree, the company may be wound up (see 12.3).

         * [Part 5.3A]

    * 12.2 Receivers

    * A receiver, or receiver and manager, may be appointed by order of a Court or under an agreement with a secured creditor to take over some or all of the assets of a company. Generally this would occur if the company is in financial difficulty. A receiver may be appointed, for example, because an amount owed to a secured creditor is overdue.

         * [Part 5.2]

    * 12.3 Winding up and distribution

    * A company may be wound up by order of a Court, or voluntarily if the shareholders of the company pass a special resolution to do so.

    * A liquidator is appointed: 

      *  	when a Court orders a company to be wound up; or

      *  	the shareholders of a company pass a resolution to wind up the company.

         * [Parts 5.4, 5.4B, 5.5].

    * 12.4 Liquidators

    * A liquidator is appointed to administer the winding up of a company. The liquidator's main functions are:

      *  	to take possession of the company's assets; and

      *  	to determine debts owed by the company and pay the company's creditors; and

      *  	to distribute to shareholders any assets of the company left over after paying creditors (any distribution to shareholders is made according to the rights attaching to their shares); and

      *  	finally, to have the company deregistered.

         * [Parts 5.4B, 5.6]

    * 12.5 Order of payment of debts

    * Generally, creditors who hold security interests in company assets are paid first.

         * [Division 6 of Part 5.6]

    * 12.6 Cancellation of registration

    * If a company has ceased trading or has been wound up, it remains on the register until ASIC cancels the company's registration. Once a company is deregistered, it ceases to exist.

##### 125  Constitution may limit powers and set out objects

    * (1) If a company has a constitution, it may contain an express restriction on, or a prohibition of, the company's exercise of any of its powers.

    * (2) A company with a common seal may execute a document if the seal is fixed to the document and the fixing of the seal is witnessed by:

     * (a) 2 directors of the company; or

     * (b) a director and a company secretary of the company; or

     * (c) for a proprietary company that has a sole director who is also the sole company secretary--that director.

    * (3) The assumptions may be made even if an officer or agent of the company acts fraudulently, or forges a document, in connection with the dealings.

    * (4) A person is not entitled to make an assumption in section 129 if at the time of the dealings they knew or suspected that the assumption was incorrect.

##### 129  Assumptions that can be made under section 128

    * (1) The directors of a company may appoint a person as a director. A person can be appointed as a director in order to make up a quorum for a directors' meeting even if the total number of directors of the company is not enough to make up that quorum.

    * Proprietary company--confirmation by meeting within 2 months

    * (2) If a person is appointed under this section as a director of a proprietary company, the company must confirm the appointment by resolution within 2 months after the appointment is made. If the appointment is not confirmed, the person ceases to be a director of the company at the end of those 2 months.

    * Public company--confirmation by next AGM

    * (3) If a person is appointed by the other directors as a director of a public company, the company must confirm the appointment by resolution at the company's next AGM. If the appointment is not confirmed, the person ceases to be a director of the company at the end of the AGM.

##### 201J  Appointment of managing directors (replaceable rule--see section 135)

    * The directors of a company may appoint 1 or more of themselves to the office of managing director of the company for the period, and on the terms (including as to remuneration), as the directors see fit.

##### 201K  Alternate directors (replaceable rule--see section 135)

    * (1) With the other directors' approval, a director may appoint an alternate to exercise some or all of the director's powers for a specified period.

    * (2) If the appointing director requests the company to give the alternate notice of directors' meetings, the company must do so.

    * (3) When an alternate exercises the director's powers, the exercise of the powers is just as effective as if the powers were exercised by the director.

    * (4) The appointing director may terminate the alternate's appointment at any time.

    * (5) An appointment or its termination must be in writing. A copy must be given to the company.

         * Note: ASIC must be given notice of the appointment and termination of appointment of an alternate (see subsections 205B(2) and (5)).

##### 201L  Signpost--ASIC to be notified of appointment

    * Under section 205B, a company must notify ASIC within 28 days if a person is appointed as a director or as an alternate director.

##### 201M  Effectiveness of acts by directors

    * (1) An act done by a director is effective even if their appointment, or the continuance of their appointment, is invalid because the company or director did not comply with the company's constitution (if any) or any provision of this Act.

    * (2) Subsection (1) does not deal with the question whether an effective act by a director:

     * (a) binds the company in its dealings with other people; or

     * (b) makes the company liable to another person.

         * Note: The kinds of acts that this section validates are those that are only legally effective if the person doing them is a director (for example, calling a meeting of the company's members or signing a document to be lodged with ASIC or minutes of a meeting). Sections 128130 contain rules about the assumptions people are entitled to make when dealing with a company and its officers.

##### Subdivision B--Limits on numbers of directors of public companies

##### 201N  Application of Subdivision

    * (1) This Subdivision applies in relation to a public company if its constitution allows its directors to set a limit (a **_board limit_**) whose effect is to restrict the number of directors of the company to a number less than the maximum number of directors specified in the constitution.

         * Note: This Subdivision applies however the constitution or board limit is expressed.

    * (2) If a company's constitution provides that the maximum number of directors is either a specified number or another number determined by the directors:

     * (a) any number determined by the directors that is lower than the specified number is a **_board limit_**; and

     * (b) any lowering by the directors of that lower number is also a **_board limit_**.

    * (3) Subsection (2) does not limit, and is not limited by, subsection (1).

##### 201P  Directors must not set board limit unless proposed limit has been approved by general meeting

    * (1) The directors must not set a board limit unless:

     * (a) a resolution (a **_board limit resolution_**) approving the proposal to set the limit specified in the resolution has been passed by a general meeting of the company; and

     * (b) the notice of the meeting set out an intention to propose the board limit resolution and stated the resolution; and

     * (c) the notice was accompanied by a statement explaining the resolution and meeting the requirements in section 201Q.

         * Note 1: Subsection 249L(3) requires information in the notice of meeting to be presented clearly, concisely and effectively.

         * Note 2: Section 201U specifies the consequences of a contravention of subsection (1) of this section. Also, section 1324 provides for injunctions to enforce subsection (1) of this section.

    * (2) A board limit resolution has effect until immediately before the start of the first AGM of the company after the general meeting by which the resolution was passed.

    * (3) A board limit resolution does not prevent the appointment of a person as a director of the company by the other directors of the company between general meetings of the company.

    * (4) However, if a person is appointed by the other directors as a director of the company while a board limit resolution has effect, the company must confirm the appointment by resolution at the company's next AGM. If the appointment is not confirmed, the person ceases to be a director of the company at the end of the AGM.

    * (5) Subsections (1), (2) and (4) have effect despite the company's constitution.

         * Note: Although subsection (4) is like subsection 201H(3) in many ways, it is not a replaceable rule like subsection 201H(3).

##### 201Q  Requirements for explanatory statement to members

    * The statement accompanying the notice of a general meeting stating an intention to propose the board limit resolution must be in writing and set out clearly, concisely and effectively:

     * (a) the directors' reasons for proposing the board limit resolution; and

     * (b) all other information that:

       * (i) is reasonably required by members in order to decide whether or not it is in the company's interests to pass the proposed board limit resolution; and

       * (ii) is known to the company or to any of its directors.

         * Note: Section 1309 creates offences where false and misleading material relating to a corporation's affairs is made available or furnished to members.

##### 201R  Records of voting on board limit resolution if poll demanded

    * (1) This section applies if a poll is duly demanded on the question that the board limit resolution be passed.

    * (2) For each member of the company who votes on the poll in person, the company must record in writing:

     * (a) the member's name; and

     * (b) how many votes the member casts for the resolution and how many against.

         * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence: see subsection 1311(1).

    * (3) For each member of the company who votes on the poll by proxy, or by a representative authorised under section 250D, the company must record in writing:

     * (a) the member's name; and

     * (b) in relation to each person who votes as proxy, or as such a representative, for the member:

       * (i) the person's name; and

       * (ii) how many votes the person casts on the resolution as proxy, or as such a representative, for the member; and

       * (iii) how many of those votes the person casts for the resolution and how many against.

         * Note: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence: see subsection 1311(1).

##### 201S  Notice of resolution to be lodged

    * The company must lodge a notice setting out the text of the board limit resolution within 14 days after the resolution is passed.

##### 201T  Declaration by court of substantial compliance

    * (1) The Court may declare that a requirement set by section 201Q, 201R or 201S has been satisfied if the Court finds that it has been substantially satisfied.

    * (2) A declaration may be made only on the application of an interested person.

##### 201U  Consequences of setting board limit in breach of section 201P

    * Application

    * (1) This section applies if the directors of the company set a board limit in contravention of subsection 201P(1).

    * Board limit etc. ineffective

    * (2) The board limit and anything done in reliance on it have no effect for the purposes of:

     * (a) the company's constitution; or

     * (b) this Act, except this section.

         * Note: If a board limit resolution is not passed, the number of directors of a company that can be appointed (for example by a general meeting) depends on the maximum number of directors specified by the company's constitution. This is so even if the directors purport to set a board limit despite the fact the board limit resolution was not passed.

    * (3) If:

     * (a) one or more directors are appointed by one or more resolutions passed at a particular general meeting of the company; and

     * (b) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not given the opportunity to pass one or more resolutions appointing a number of directors such that the number of directors of the company would (if those resolutions had been passed) have exceeded the board limit;

    * every appointment of director made by a resolution passed at the general meeting is invalid.

         * Note: This subsection does not apply if a shortage of persons consenting to be appointed director was the reason the general meeting was not given the opportunity to pass one or more resolutions appointing a number of directors such that the number of directors of the company would (if those resolutions had been passed) have exceeded the board limit.

    * (4) Subsections (2) and (3) have effect despite anything else in the company's constitution or in this Act, except sections 128, 129 and 201M.

         * Note: Sections 128 and 129 deal with assumptions a person dealing with the company may make, including assumptions about the due appointment of directors. Section 201M deals with effectiveness of acts by a director in circumstances where the director's appointment is invalid for certain reasons.

    * Company and candidates for directors may seek compensation

    * (5) Subsection (6) applies if either of the following (the **_suffering party_**) suffers loss or damage because of the setting of the board limit in contravention of subsection 201P(1):

     * (a) the company;

     * (b) a person for whom both the following conditions are met:

       * (i) the person had given the company a written indication that he or she would be a candidate to be appointed director at a general meeting;

       * (ii) because of the board limit, the general meeting was not given the opportunity to consider passing a resolution to appoint the person as director.

    * (6) The suffering party may institute a proceeding in the Court for the contravention.

         * Note: Section 1325 deals with the orders the Court may make to compensate the suffering party for the loss.

    * Contravention does not give rise to an offence

    * (7) A person is not guilty of an offence because of the contravention.

     * (b) at least 100 members who are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company.

    * The company must disclose all remuneration paid to the director, regardless of whether it is paid to the director in relation to their capacity as director or another capacity.

    * (2) On a show of hands, a declaration by the chair is conclusive evidence of the result, provided that the declaration reflects the show of hands and the votes of the proxies received. Neither the chair nor the minutes need to state the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour or against.

         * Note: Even though the chair's declaration is conclusive of the voting results, the members present may demand a poll (see paragraph 250L(3)(c)).

     * (c) a resolution was not put to the vote at the earlier AGM under an earlier application of section 250V.

         * Note: Subsection 250R(2) requires a resolution to adopt a remuneration report for a listed company to be put to the vote at the company's AGM.

##### 250V  Resolution to hold fresh elections for directors at special meeting to be put to vote at AGM

    * (1) At the later AGM, there must be put to the vote a resolution (the **_spill resolution_**) that:

##### 250W  Consequences of spill resolution being passed

    * (1) This section applies if the spill resolution is passed.

    * Deadline for holding spill meeting

    * (2) The company must hold the spill meeting within 90 days after the spill resolution was passed.

    * (3) Nothing in subsection (2) authorises any person to disregard:

     * (a) section 249HA (Amount of notice of meetings of listed company); or

     * (b) if a person intends to move a resolution relating to the appointment of a director of the company--any provision of the company's constitution that requires a minimum period of notice for such a resolution.

         * Note: Division 3 (which includes section 249HA) deals with giving notice of the spill meeting. Division 5 contains rules relevant to holding the spill meeting.

    * If relevant directors cease to hold office before deadline

    * (4) The company need not hold the spill meeting within 90 days after the spill resolution was passed if, before the end of that period, none of the company's directors described in paragraph 250V(1)(b) remain as directors of the company.

    * Consequences of failure to hold spill meeting in time

    * (5) If the company does not hold the spill meeting within 90 days after the spill resolution was passed, each person who is a director of the company at the end of those 90 days commits an offence.

         * Note: A person who is a director at the end of those 90 days may commit an offence even if he or she was not a director when the spill resolution was passed.

    * (6) An offence against subsection (5) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For strict liability, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (7) Subsection (5) does not apply if the company need not hold the spill meeting because of subsection (4).

         * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (7): see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * (8) Subsection (5) does not apply to a person who was not a director of the company at any time during the period:

     * (a) starting when the spill resolution was passed; and

     * (b) ending at the last time notice of the spill meeting could have been given to hold the spill meeting within 90 days after the spill resolution was passed and comply with section 249HA (Amount of notice of meetings of listed company).

         * Note: A defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to the matter in subsection (8): see subsection 13.3(3) of the _Criminal Code_.

    * Cessation of relevant directors and commencement of newlyappointed directors

    * (9) All the company's directors described in paragraph 250V(1)(b) cease to hold office immediately before the end of the spill meeting and the directors appointed by the meeting commence to hold office at the end of that meeting. This subsection has effect despite anything else in this Act and the company's constitution.

##### 250X  Ensuring there are at least 3 directors after spill meeting

    * (1) This section applies if there would be fewer than 3 directors of the company immediately after the spill meeting apart from this section.

         * Note: Subsection 201A(2) requires the company to have at least 3 directors.

    * (2) Enough directors to ensure that the company has 3 directors immediately after the spill meeting are taken to have been appointed, by resolution passed at the spill meeting, from the persons who:

     * (a) gave the company signed consents to act as directors of the company in anticipation of being appointed by such a resolution; and

     * (b) were not appointed as directors by such a resolution apart from this section.

         * Note: The number of directors taken under subsection (2) to have been appointed is the difference between 3 and the number of directors holding office immediately after the spill meeting apart from this section.

    * (3) The persons taken to have been appointed are those with the highest percentages of votes favouring their appointment cast at the spill meeting on the resolution for their appointment (even if less than half the votes cast on the resolution were in favour of their appointment).

    * (2) Assets and liabilities are to be calculated for the purposes of this section in accordance with accounting standards in force at the relevant time (even if the standard does not otherwise apply to the financial year of some or all of the companies concerned).

##### 254U  Other provisions about paying dividends (replaceable rule--see section 135)

    * (1) The directors may determine that a dividend is payable and fix:

     * (a) the amount; and

     * (b) the time for payment; and

     * (c) the method of payment.

    * The methods of payment may include the payment of cash, the issue of shares, the grant of options and the transfer of assets.

    * (2) Interest is not payable on a dividend.

##### 254V  When does the company incur a debt?

    * (1) A company does not incur a debt merely by fixing the amount or time for payment of a dividend. The debt arises only when the time fixed for payment arrives and the decision to pay the dividend may be revoked at any time before then.

    * (2) However, if the company has a constitution and it provides for the declaration of dividends, the company incurs a debt when the dividend is declared.

##### 254W  Dividend rights

    * Shares in public companies

    * (1) Each share in a class of shares in a public company has the same dividend rights unless:

     * (a) the company has a constitution and it provides for the shares to have different dividend rights; or

     * (b) different dividend rights are provided for by special resolution of the company.

    * Shares in proprietary companies (replaceable rule--see section 135)

    * (2) Subject to the terms on which shares in a proprietary company are on issue, the directors may pay dividends as they see fit.

    * No liability companies

    * (3) A person is not entitled to a dividend on a share in a no liability company if a call:

     * (a) has been made on the share; and

     * (b) is due and unpaid.

    * (4) Dividends are payable to the shareholders in a no liability company in proportion to the number of shares held by them, irrespective of the amount paid up, or credited as paid up, on the shares. This subsection has effect subject to any provisions in the company's constitution relating to shares that are not ordinary shares.

### Part 2H.6--Notice requirements

##### 254X  Notice to ASIC of share issue

    * (1) Within 28 days after issuing shares, a company must lodge with ASIC a notice in the prescribed form that sets out:

     * (a) the number of shares that were issued; and

         * Note 1: The company must lodge information when rights attached to the shares change, or when the shares are divided or converted into new classes (see section 246F).

         * Note 2: A proprietary company may also have to notify certain particulars under Part 2C.2.

    * (2) If the shares were issued for noncash consideration under a contract, the company must also lodge with ASIC a certificate stating that all stamp duty payable on the contract under any applicable law relating to stamp duty has been paid. This certificate must be lodged with the subsection (1) notice or at a later time permitted by the regulations or by ASIC.

    * (2A) An offence based on subsection (1) or (2) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: Information about shares issued in these situations will come to ASIC under subsections 5H(2), 117(2), 163(3) and 601BC(2).

##### 254Y  Notice to ASIC of share cancellation

    * (1) Within 1 month after shares are cancelled, the company must lodge with ASIC a notice in the prescribed form that sets out:

         * subsection 257H(3) (shares a company has bought back), section 258D (forfeited shares), and subsections 258E(2) and (3) (shares returned to a company).


    * (2) An offence based on subsection (1) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

## Chapter 2J--Transactions affecting share capital

### Part 2J.1--Share capital reductions and share buybacks

##### 256A  Purpose

    * This Part states the rules to be followed by a company for reductions in share capital and for share buybacks. The rules are designed to protect the interests of shareholders and creditors by:

     * (a) addressing the risk of these transactions leading to the company's insolvency

     * (b) seeking to ensure fairness between the company's shareholders

     * (c) requiring the company to disclose all material information.

#### Division 1--Reductions in share capital not otherwise authorised by law

##### 256B  Company may make reduction not otherwise authorised

    * (1) A company may reduce its share capital in a way that is not otherwise authorised by law if the reduction:

     * (a) is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole; and

     * (b) does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors; and

     * (c) is approved by shareholders under section 256C.

    * A cancellation of a share for no consideration is a reduction of share capital, but paragraph (b) does not apply to this kind of reduction.

         * Note 1: One of the ways in which a company might reduce its share capital is cancelling uncalled capital.

         * Note 2: Sections 258A258F deal with some of the other situations in which reductions of share capital are authorised. Subsection 254K(2) authorises capital reductions involved in the redemption of redeemable preference shares and subsection 257A(2) authorises reductions involved in share buybacks.

         * Note 3: For a director's duty to prevent insolvent trading on reductions of share capital, see section 588G.

         * Note 4: For the criminal liability of a person dishonestly involved in a contravention of subsection 256D(1) based on this subsection, see subsection 256D(4). Section 79 defines **_involved_**.

    * (1A) To avoid doubt, a cancellation of a partlypaid share is taken to be for consideration.

    * (2) The reduction is either an equal reduction or a selective reduction. The reduction is an **_equal reduction_** if:

     * (a) it relates only to ordinary shares; and

     * (b) it applies to each holder of ordinary shares in proportion to the number of ordinary shares they hold; and

     * (c) the terms of the reduction are the same for each holder of ordinary shares.

    * Otherwise, the reduction is a **_selective reduction_**.

    * (3) In applying subsection (2), ignore differences in the terms of the reduction that are:

     * (a) attributable to the fact that shares have different accrued dividend entitlements; or

     * (b) attributable to the fact that shares have different amounts unpaid on them; or

     * (c) introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares.

##### 256C  Shareholder approval

    * Ordinary resolution required for equal reduction

    * (1) If the reduction is an equal reduction, it must be approved by a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company.

    * Special shareholder approval for selective reduction

    * (2) If the reduction is a selective reduction, it must be approved by either:

     * (a) a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any person who is to receive consideration as part of the reduction or whose liability to pay amounts unpaid on shares is to be reduced, or by their associates; or

     * (b) a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders.

    * If the reduction involves the cancellation of shares, the reduction must also be approved by a special resolution passed at a meeting of the shareholders whose shares are to be cancelled.

    * (3) The company must lodge with ASIC a copy of any resolution under subsection (2) within 14 days after it is passed. The company must not make the reduction until 14 days after lodgment.

         * Note: A proprietary company may also have to notify certain particulars under Part 2C.2.

    * Information to accompany the notice of meeting

    * (4) The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision on how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

    * Documents to be lodged with ASIC

    * (5) Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with ASIC a copy of:

     * (a) the notice of the meeting; and

     * (b) any document relating to the reduction that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

##### 256D  Consequences of failing to comply with section 256B

    * (1) The company must not make the reduction unless it complies with subsection 256B(1).

    * (2) If the company contravenes subsection (1):

     * (a) the contravention does not affect the validity of the reduction or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

     * (b) the company is not guilty of an offence.

    * (3) Any person who is involved in a company's contravention of subsection (1) contravenes this subsection.

         * Note 1: Subsection (3) is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E).

         * Note 2: Section 79 defines **_involved_**.

    * (4) A person commits an offence if they are involved in a company's contravention of subsection (1) and the involvement is dishonest.

##### 256E  Signposts to other relevant provisions

    * The following table lists other provisions of this Act that are relevant to reductions in share capital.

#### Division 2--Share buybacks

##### 257A  The company's power to buy back its own shares

    * A company may buy back its own shares if: 

     * (a) the buyback does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors; and

     * (b) the company follows the procedures laid down in this Division.

         * Note 1: If a company has a constitution, it may include provisions in the constitution that preclude the company buying back its own shares or impose restrictions on the exercise of the company's power to buy back its own shares.

         * Note 2: A company may buyback redeemable preference shares and may do so on terms other than the terms on which they could be redeemed. For the redemption of redeemable preference shares, see sections 254J254L.

##### 257B  Buyback procedure--general

    * (1) The following table specifies the steps required for, and the sections that apply to, the different types of buyback.

         * Note: Subsections (2) and (3) of this section explain what an equal access scheme is. The 10/12 limit is the 10% in 12 months limit laid down in subsections (4) and (5). Subsections (6) and (7) of this section explain what an onmarket buyback is. See section 9 for definitions of **_minimum holding buyback_**, **_employee share scheme buyback_** and **_selective buyback_**.

    * Equal access scheme

    * (2) An equal access scheme is a scheme that satisfies all the following conditions:

     * (a) the offers under the scheme relate only to ordinary shares;

     * (b) the offers are to be made to every person who holds ordinary shares to buy back the same percentage of their ordinary shares;

     * (c) all of those persons have a reasonable opportunity to accept the offers made to them;

     * (d) buyback agreements are not entered into until a specified time for acceptances of offers has closed;

     * (e) the terms of all the offers are the same.

    * (3) In applying subsection (2), ignore:

     * (a) differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares having different accrued dividend entitlements;

     * (b) differences in consideration attributable to the fact that the offers relate to shares on which different amounts remain unpaid;

     * (c) differences in the offers introduced solely to ensure that each shareholder is left with a whole number of shares.

    * 10/12 limit

    * (4) The 10/12 limit for a company proposing to make a buyback is 10% of the smallest number, at any time during the last 12 months, of votes attaching to voting shares of the company.

    * Exceeding the 10/12 limit

    * (5) A proposed buyback would exceed the 10/12 limit if the number of votes attaching to:

     * (a) all the voting shares in the company that have been bought back during the last 12 months; and

     * (b) the voting shares that will be bought back if the proposed buyback is made;

    * would exceed the 10/12 limit.

    * Onmarket buybacks

    * (6) A buyback is an onmarket buyback if it results from an offer made by a listed corporation on a prescribed financial market in the ordinary course of trading on that market.

    * (7) A buyback by a company (whether listed or not) is also an onmarket buyback if it results from an offer made in the ordinary course of trading in a financial market outside  which ASIC declares in writing to be an approved overseas financial market for the purposes of this subsection. A buyback by a listed company is an onmarket buyback under this subsection only if an offer to buyback those shares is also made on a prescribed financial market at the same time.

    * (8) A declaration under subsection (7) may be subject to conditions. Notice of the making of the declaration must be published in the _Gazette_.

##### 257C  Buyback procedure--shareholder approval if the 10/12 limit exceeded

    * Ordinary resolution required

    * (1) If section 257B applies this section to a buyback, the terms of the buyback agreement must be approved before it is entered into by a resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, or the agreement must be conditional on such an approval.

    * Information to accompany the notice of meeting

    * (2) The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

    * Documents to be lodged with the ASIC

    * (3) Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with ASIC a copy of:

     * (a) the notice of the meeting; and

     * (b) any document relating to the buyback that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

##### 257D  Buyback procedure--special shareholder approval for selective buyback

    * Selective buyback requires special or unanimous resolution

    * (1) If section 257B applies this section to a buyback, the terms of the buyback agreement must be approved before it is entered into by either:

     * (a) a special resolution passed at a general meeting of the company, with no votes being cast in favour of the resolution by any person whose shares are proposed to be bought back or by their associates; or

     * (b) a resolution agreed to, at a general meeting, by all ordinary shareholders;

    * or the agreement must be conditional on such an approval.

    * Information to accompany the notice of meeting

    * (2) The company must include with the notice of the meeting a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision how to vote on the resolution. However, the company does not have to disclose information if it would be unreasonable to require the company to do so because the company had previously disclosed the information to its shareholders.

    * Documents to be lodged with the ASIC

    * (3) Before the notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders, the company must lodge with ASIC a copy of:

     * (a) the notice of the meeting; and

     * (b) any document relating to the buyback that will accompany the notice of the meeting sent to shareholders.

    * (4) ASIC may exempt a company from the operation of this section. The exemption:

     * (a) must be in writing; and

     * (b) must be granted before the buyback agreement is entered into; and

     * (c) may be granted subject to conditions.

##### 257E  Buyback procedure--lodgment of offer documents with ASIC

    * If section 257B applies this section to a buyback, the company must lodge with ASIC, before the buyback agreement is entered into, a copy of:

     * (a) a document setting out the terms of the offer; and

     * (b) any document that is to accompany the offer.

##### 257F  Notice of intended buyback

    * (1) If section 257B applies this section to a buyback, the company must satisfy the lodgment requirement in subsection (2) at least 14 days before:

     * (a) if the buyback agreement is conditional on the passing of a resolution under subsection 257C(1) or 257D(1)--the resolution is passed; or

     * (b) if it is not--the agreement is entered into.

    * (2) The company satisfies the lodgment requirement when it lodges with ASIC:

     * (a) documents under subsection 257C(3) or 257D(3) or section 257E; or

     * (b) a notice that the company intends to carry out the buyback.

         * Note 1: A company that has to lodge documents under section 257C, 257D or 257E needs to lodge a notice under paragraph (2)(b) of this section only if it wants for some reason to enter into the agreement or pass the resolution less than 14 days after lodging the section 257C, 257D or 257E documents.

         * Note 2: The company may specify a buyback under paragraph (2)(b) in any way. It may, for instance, choose to lodge a notice covering buybacks to be carried out:

            * under a particular scheme; or

            * as part of particular onmarket buyback activity.

##### 257G  Buyback procedure--disclosure of relevant information when offer made

    * If section 257B applies this section to a buyback, the company must include with the offer to buy back shares a statement setting out all information known to the company that is material to the decision whether to accept the offer.

##### 257H  Acceptance of offer and transfer of shares to the company

    * Effect of acceptance of the buyback offer on share rights

    * (1) Once a company has entered into an agreement to buy back shares, all rights attaching to the shares are suspended. The suspension is lifted if the agreement is terminated.

    * Shares transferred to the company and cancelled

    * (2) A company must not dispose of shares it buys back. An agreement entered into in contravention of this subsection is void.

    * (3) Immediately after the registration of the transfer to the company of the shares bought back, the shares are cancelled.

         * Note: ASIC must be notified of the cancellation under section 254Y.

##### 257J  Signposts to other relevant provisions

    * The following table sets out other provisions of this Act that are relevant to buybacks.

#### Division 3--Other share capital reductions

##### 258A  Unlimited companies

    * An unlimited company may reduce its share capital in any way.

##### 258B  Right to occupy or use real property

    * (1) If a company has a constitution, under it the company may grant to a shareholder, as a shareholder, a right to occupy or use real property that the company owns or holds under lease, whether the right is a lease or licence or a contractual right.

         * Note: Before the introduction of strata or unit titles systems, rights to occupy real property were sometimes based on a holding of shares in a company.

    * (2) A company may transfer to a person an interest in land in exchange for, or in satisfaction of, a right to occupy or use the land of the kind referred to in subsection (1).

         * Example: A person has a right to occupy an apartment in a block of units because they hold shares in a company. As part of converting the block of units to strata title, the person surrenders the shares in return for a transfer of strata title over the apartment. The capital reduction involved in the transfer is authorised under this subsection.

##### 258C  Brokerage or commission

    * A company may pay brokerage or commission to a person in respect of that person or another person agreeing to take up shares in the company.

##### 258D  Cancellation of forfeited shares

    * A company may, by resolution passed at a general meeting, cancel shares that have been forfeited under the terms on which the shares are on issue.

##### 258E  Other share cancellations

    * (1) Any reduction in share capital involved in:

     * (a) the redemption of redeemable preference shares out of the proceeds of a new issue of shares made for the purpose of the redemption (see section 254K); or

     * (b) a company's buyingback of its own shares under sections 257A to 257J if the shares are paid for out of share capital.

    * is authorised by this section.

    * (2) A company may cancel shares returned to it under section 651C, 724(2), 737 or 738 and any reduction in the company's share capital that is involved is authorised by this subsection.

    * (3) Any reduction in a company's share capital because of an order under section 1325A is authorised by this subsection.

##### 258F  Reductions because of lost capital

    * (1) A company may reduce its share capital by cancelling any paidup share capital that is lost or is not represented by available assets.

    * (2) This power does not apply if:

    * Special exemptions for financial institutions

    * (5) Any voting rights attached to the shares (or units of shares) cannot be exercised while the company continues to hold them.

    * (6) If, at the end of the 12 months (or extended period), the company still holds any of the shares (or units of shares), the company commits an offence for each day while that situation continues.

    * (7) An offence based on subsection (6) is an offence of strict liability.

         * Note: For **_strict liability_**, see section 6.1 of the _Criminal Code_.

##### 259C  Issuing or transferring shares to controlled entity

     * (a) the issue or transfer is to the entity as a personal representative; or

    * ASIC may extend this period of 12 months if the company applies for the extension before the end of the period.

    * (2) If this section applies to shares (or units of shares), it also applies to bonus shares issued in respect of those shares (or units of shares). Within the same period that applies to the shares themselves under subsection (1), either:

     * (a) the entity must cease to hold the bonus shares; or

     * (b) the company must cease to control the entity.

    * (3) Any voting rights attached to the shares (or units of shares) cannot be exercised while the company continues to control the entity.

    * (4) If, at the end of the 12 months (or extended period), the company still controls the entity and the entity still holds the shares (or units of shares), the company commits an offence for each day while that situation continues.

       * (i) the interest arises from a security given for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of business in connection with providing finance; and

       * (ii) that transaction was not entered into with an associate of the company or an entity it controls.

    * (6) A contravention of this section does not affect the validity of any transaction.

##### 259E  When a company controls an entity

    * (1) For the purposes of this Part, a company controls an entity if the company has the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about the entity's financial and operating policies.

    * (2) In determining whether a company has this capacity:

     * (a) the practical influence the company can exert (rather than the rights it can enforce) is the issue to be addressed; and

     * (b) any practice or pattern of behaviour affecting the entity's financial or operating policies is to be taken into account (even if it involves a breach of an agreement or a breach of trust).

    * (3) Merely because the company and an unrelated entity jointly have the capacity to determine the outcome of decisions about another entity's financial and operating policies, the company does not control the other entity.

    * (4) A company is not taken to control an entity merely because of a capacity that it is under a legal obligation to exercise for the benefit of someone other than its shareholders.

         * Note: This situation could arise, for example, if the company holds shares as a trustee or is performing duties as a liquidator.

##### 259F  Consequences of failing to comply with section 259A or 259B

    * (1) If a company contravenes section 259A or subsection 259B(1):

     * (a) the contravention does not affect the validity of the acquisition or security or of any contract or transaction connected with it; and

     * (b) the company is not guilty of an offence.

    * (2) Any person who is involved in a company's contravention of section 259A or subsection 259B(1) contravenes this subsection.

         * Note 1: Subsection (2) is a civil penalty provision (see section 1317E).

         * Note 2: Section 79 defines **_involved_**.

    * (3) A person commits an offence if they are involved in a company's contravention of section 259A or subsection 259B(1) and the involvement is dishonest.

       * (ii) the company's ability to pay its creditors; or

     * (b) the assistance is approved by shareholders under section 260B (that section also requires advance notice to ASIC); or

     * (c) the assistance is exempted under section 260C.

    * Approval by shareholders of listed holding corporation
