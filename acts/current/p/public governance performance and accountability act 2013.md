Officials

    * There are general duties that apply to all officials. Those duties are set out in sections 25 to 29.

### Part 24--Use and management of public resources

#### Division 1--Guide to this Part

##### 50  Guide to this Part

    * This Part is about the use and management of public resources by the Commonwealth and Commonwealth entities.

    * Many of the provisions in this Part apply to either the Commonwealth or corporate Commonwealth entities, and do not expressly refer to noncorporate Commonwealth entities. This is because noncorporate Commonwealth entities are legally part of the Commonwealth. Generally, the Finance Minister has the power to act on behalf of the Commonwealth for the purposes of the provisions of this Part.

    * Division 2 allows the Finance Minister to make available to Commonwealth entities amounts that have been appropriated by the Parliament for the entity. It also allows the rules to prescribe matters relating to the commitment or expenditure of relevant money by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth entities.

    * Division 3 is about banking for the Commonwealth and corporate Commonwealth entities. It also has requirements about how Ministers and officials are to deal with relevant money that they receive.

    * Division 4 is about borrowing by the Commonwealth and corporate Commonwealth entities.

    * Division 5 is about investment by the Commonwealth and corporate Commonwealth entities.

    * Division 6 is about indemnities, guarantees and warranties by the Commonwealth and corporate Commonwealth entities, and insurance obtained by corporate Commonwealth entities.

    * Division 7 is about the Commonwealth. It deals with the Commonwealth:

     *  	waiving amounts owed to it; and

     *  	setting off amounts owed to, or by, it against another amount that is owed to, or by, another person; and

     *  	granting act of grace payments to a person.

    * Division 8 has special provisions that apply to Ministers and officials of noncorporate Commonwealth entities.

     *  	Subdivision A prohibits Ministers and those officials from making gifts of relevant property unless authorised as provided in section 66.

     *  	Subdivision B makes Ministers and those officials liable to pay an amount to the Commonwealth if they make an unauthorised gift or are responsible for the loss of relevant money or relevant property.

    * Division 9 has requirements that apply to Ministers only. Section 71 has requirements that apply to a Minister when the Minister is approving proposed expenditure. Section 72 requires a Minister who has responsibility for certain events (for example, the forming of a new company) to inform Parliament of the event.

#### Division 2--Funding and expenditure

##### 51  Making amounts appropriated available to Commonwealth entities

    * (1) If an amount is appropriated by the Parliament in relation to a Commonwealth entity, then the Finance Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, make the appropriated amount available to the entity in such instalments, and at such times, as the Finance Minister considers appropriate.

    * (2) However, the Finance Minister must make an amount available if:

     * (a) a law requires the payment of the amount; and

     * (b) the Finance Minister is satisfied that there is an available appropriation.

##### 52  Commitment or expenditure of relevant money

    * The rules may prescribe matters relating to the commitment or expenditure of relevant money by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth entity.

#### Division 3--Banking

##### 53  Banking by the Commonwealth

    * (1) The Finance Minister may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, enter into an agreement with a bank relating to the conduct of the banking business of the Commonwealth, including in relation to opening and maintaining bank accounts.

     * (a) must not provide for overdraft drawings by the Commonwealth unless it provides for each drawing to be repaid within 30 days; and

     * (b) must be in accordance with any requirements prescribed by the rules.

        * Note: An overdraft drawing consists of the bank meeting the payment of a cheque, or making an "electronic payment" to another account, and in each case debiting the payment against an account that has an insufficient balance.

    * (3) The Finance Minister must, on behalf of the Commonwealth, open and maintain a central bank account with the Reserve Bank of Australia.

    * (4) The rules may prescribe matters relating to banking by the Commonwealth, except in relation to the central bank account referred to in subsection (3).

##### 54  Banking by corporate Commonwealth entities

    * The rules may prescribe matters relating to banking by corporate Commonwealth entities.

##### 55  Banking or dealing with relevant money

    * Ministers

    * (1) A Minister who receives relevant money (other than relevant money that is to be held for the purposes of making payments in relation to the Minister's official duties) must give the money to an official of a noncorporate Commonwealth entity as soon as is practicable.

    * Officials receiving bankable money

    * (2) An official of a Commonwealth entity who receives relevant money that can be deposited in a bank (**_bankable money_**) must:

     * (a) deposit the bankable money in a bank:

      * (i) within the period prescribed by the rules or, if the rules do not prescribe a period, as soon as is practicable; and

    * Officials receiving unbankable money

    * (3) The rules may prescribe matters relating to relevant money that:

     * (a) is received by an official of a Commonwealth entity; and

     * (b) is not bankable money.

    * Application of section

    * (4) To avoid doubt, this section applies to money that becomes relevant money on receipt by a Minister or an official of a Commonwealth entity.

#### Division 4--Borrowing

##### 56  Borrowing by the Commonwealth

    * (3) An investment under this section must not be inconsistent with the terms of any trust that applies to the money concerned.

    * (4) If an amount invested under this section was debited from a special account, then expenses of the investment may be debited from that special account.

    * (5) The proceeds of an investment of an amount debited from a special account must be credited to the special account.

    * (6) At any time before an investment matures, the Finance Minister or Treasurer, as the case requires, may, on behalf of the Commonwealth, authorise in writing the reinvestment of the proceeds upon maturity in an authorised investment with the same entity.

    * (8) Any of the following are an **_authorised investment_**:

     * (a) in relation to both the Finance Minister and the Treasurer:

      * (i) securities of, or securities guaranteed by, the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory; or

      * (ii) a deposit with a bank, including a deposit evidenced by a certificate of deposit; or

      * (v) for a government business enterprise--in any other form of investment that is consistent with sound commercial practice.

    * (2) A spending limit provision in the corporate Commonwealth entity's enabling legislation does not apply to a contract for the investment of money under subsection (1), unless the provision expressly states that it applies to such a contract.
